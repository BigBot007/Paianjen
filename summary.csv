"Did You Miss Out on Hamster Races, Anon? HAMS Token Jumps 783%","Hamster fever is here.  After Hamsters.gg—a website that lets users bet crypto on livestreamed hamster races—took off on Thursday, the platform’s own token has now skyrocketed in price. The price of the Ethereum-based token, HAMS, jumped 783% in a 24-hour span on the Uniswap V2 decentralized exchange, per data from Dexscreener, rising from about $0.29 on Thursday to a peak of $2.56 Friday afternoon. The price of HAMS is quickly losing pace, however, currently sitting at $1.73 on Uniswap V2. CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency price tracker, shows the current market price at $1.82 with a brief peak of $2.40 earlier this afternoon. That extreme price movement has attracted significant attention and speculative interest from crypto traders. Despite the fact that only yesterday, the fluffy rodent-affiliated token had a market capitalization of $1 million, according to its creators, it has seen over $15.3 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko."
"Canadians Are Having Crypto Stolen From Their Homes, Police Say","Canadian neighborhoods are being plagued by a wave of home-invasion style robberies in search of wealthy crypto investors’ private keys, according to local police.  According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)’s website, a warning has been issued by police in Richmond and Delta about the rising trend, as “several robberies” of this nature have occurred.  Investigations are still ongoing, and police have not provided details regarding specific incidents, or the amount of cryptocurrency that’s been stolen. Police are also yet to determine whether there’s a link between individual incidents, though a “discernible pattern” is emerging between each, authorities have said. “In each of the cases, the suspects gain access to a victim’s home by posing as delivery people or persons of authority,” the RCMP stated. “Once let inside the home, the suspects rob the victims of information that gives access to their cryptocurrency accounts.” The physical nature of the theft stands in sharp contrast to the more common sorts of crypto crime in the industry, such as online scams and ransomware attacks. Such criminals usually leverage the pseudonymity of blockchain networks and the irreversibility of transactions—and typically do so from a distance."
Coutts Apologizes for 'Unbanking' Bitcoin-Friendly Nigel Farage,"Nigel Farage, a right-wing British politician, has received an apology after his account with a high-end bank was closed because his views didn't align with its ""values."" Farage—who has been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies and appeared at Bitcoin Amsterdam last year—claimed Coutts de-banked him because he was ""xenophobic and racist."" Coutts, which counts members of the Royal Family among its clientele, had initially denied this—amid reports his balance had fallen below the minimum of £1m ($1.3m). But Farage, who played an instrumental role in the U.K's decision to leave the European Union, released a damning dossier that claimed he had been ""canceled"" by the bank because he retweeted a joke by Ricky Gervais, and was friends with tennis star Novak Djokovic. The row speedily reached the upper echelons of British politics. The former Brexit Party leader even received support from more moderate MPs in Westminster, as well as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Coutts, which was established in 1692, is owned by the NatWest Group—which remains 38.6% owned by U.K. taxpayers following the 2008 financial crisis."
Former Binance US CEO Brian Brooks Joins Crypto Asset Manager Hashdex,"Brian Brooks is dipping his toe into crypto once again—and has joined the board of crypto-focused asset manager Hashdex. It comes almost two years after the executive abruptly stepped down as Binance.US CEO just four months into the job—citing ""differences over strategic direction."" His ill-fated stint in the role wasn't mentioned in Hashdex's news release, which instead decided to focus on his time as Coinbase's chief legal officer, and acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Brooks has most recently served as a partner in Valor Capital Group, which has invested in Hashdex. As well as acting as Valor's representative on the board, the entrepreneur is set to provide counsel on global regulation ""to accelerate Hashdex's continued growth in global markets""—and help institutional investors securely gain exposure to digital assets. He will also be tasked with bridging the gap between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance—at a time when U.S. regulators are embarking on a brutal clampdown. Just this week, Ritchie Torres, the New York Democrat Congressman openly accused Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler of being ""intent on sabotaging the industry."""
Binance Labs Puts $10 Million Into Radiant Capital to Expand to Other Chains,"Binance Labs announced that it's investing millions into DeFi lending protocol Radiant Capital in a bid to connect more blockchains together, and thus improve how easily users can lend or borrow across them. Radiant Capital—which is already built on top of another Binance-supported company known as LayerZero Labs—will receive $10 million to execute its expansion plans, including $5 million to go towards Radiant's DAO. The protocol currently allows users to borrow and deposit tokens, and the goal is to extend this capability to more than one blockchain, beyond where it currently resides on the BNB Chain and Arbitrum on the Ethereum blockchain. LayerZero hit a $3 billion in April following a fundraising round backed by Christie’s and Samsung. Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and is co-founder of Binance along with her partner Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, touted the investment in Radiant as a way of ""driving mass adoption"" of DeFi protocols across the crypto ecosystem. A spokesperson for Radiant said that it intends to be ""chain-agnostic,"" and intends to launch on every EVM compatible chain that the DAO votes in favor of. They add that this approach will promote more transparency in a way that does not cost users any security in their transactions. Binance Labs has previously supported similar bridging projects, including Cosmos Labs' development of its Neutron platform, a smart contract solution that is designed for connecting projects across different chains. "
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Wants Bitcoin Backed U.S. Dollars and Tax Breaks for Investors,"Democratic Presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr. has two daring new policies for his eventual administration: Exempt Bitcoin (BTC) holders from capital gains tax and back the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills with a percentage of hard currencies, such as BTC. “Bitcoin is among the hardest currencies and the Kennedy administration is going to encourage its proliferation and propagation,” said Kennedy at a political action committee (PAC) event dubbed Heal-the-Divide. The first of Kennedy’s audacious ideas, to exempt capital gains tax when Bitcoin is exchanged for U.S. Dollars, was accompanied by a recognition of its downsides. “This will give windfall to many Bitcoiners that have a great deal of money,” said the presidential candidate, but added that “the benefits dwarf the downfalls.” This is a bid to counter moves from crypto-friendly countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Germany and Portugal. He thinks the tax exemption policy will spur investment, ensure citizen privacy, and incentivize top talent to stay in the United States. “My administration’s mission is to make America the hub of cryptocurrency and particularly of Bitcoin,” he said."
Ethereum ICO Whale Moves $116M in ETH to Kraken,"A wallet address containing pre-mined Ethereum worth $116 million in current prices transferred its entire balance of 61,216 ETH to an address associated with the Kraken crypto exchange. The wallet had remained dormant for eight years before this transaction took place on July 18, at 11:30 pm UTC. As revealed by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the wallet was part of Ethereum's public crowdsale in 2014, with the owner securing their tokens at an ICO price of approximately $0.31 per ETH. An Ethereum ICO participant woke up after 8 years of dormancy and deposited all 61,216 $ETH($116M) to #Kraken 2 hrs ago. He received 61,216 $ETH($116M currently) at Ethereum Genesis, the ETH ICO price is ~$0.31.https://t.co/HLSXvqyBDb pic.twitter.com/YWVlIcxN99"
Chinese Police Arrest 21 in $54M USDT Money Laundering Probe,"Police in China’s northern Shanxi Province have uncovered an alleged Tether (USDT) money laundering scheme, leading to 21 arrests, according to local reports. The scheme, which used U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin USDT, is estimated to have generated more than $54 million for the supposed perpetrators, per China’s national broadcasting service CCTV. The police investigation alleges that the suspects, operating across six different cities in four provinces, were involved in purchasing discounted USDT through over-the-counter crypto trading services starting in October 2021. They are then said to have profited illegally by selling these tokens at inflated prices via WeChat and money laundering platforms. Over the course of nearly three years, this brought in about $54.8 million. The alleged conspiracy was discovered when police noticed an abnormal flow of funds into one individual’s account. This prompted suspicion of possible “running points,” a type of money laundering in which one person uses their own bank card or online payment method to collect money from others, then transfer it."
Genesis Trading Saw 'Uptick' in Altcoin Activity After Ripple SEC Decision,"Institutional trading platform Genesis Trading claims to have seen increased activity in altcoins following the latest developments in the Ripple SEC case. Less than a week ago, federal district judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP do not qualify as securities, but institutional sales of XRP do qualify the coin as a security. ""We've seen a little bit of an uptick in activity for alts, after the XRP decision,"" Joshua Barkhordar, head of sales at Genesis Trading, told Decrypt. ""We're also seeing a lot of clients showing interest in alts, where they may not have shown it otherwise, before."" Altcoins refer to any cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum; which Barkhordar mentioned has also seen ""a lot of activity"" following the XRP ruling.  ""In the months prior to this, when Bitcoin was trading around $25,000 to $27,000, clients were opening up strike prices around $30,000 to $33,000,"" Barkhordar said, adding that, ""we've seen institutional clients position themselves for potential upside.” Following the judge’s ruling on XRP, “we started to realize some of that upside—and, if anything, clients are kind of jumping on the bandwagon and getting more bullish now."""
Crypto.com Adds Reddit’s Moons Token as Kraken Listing Rumor Fades,"Moons, the native token of cryptocurrency users on Reddit, is now listed on Crypto.com, causing its price to soar for a second day straight.  According to Coingecko, the token is up 141% on the day, trading hands at $0.41. Moons had already jumped triple digits on Monday on news that Kraken crypto exchange was considering a listing.  Although Crypto.com is joining a number of other exchanges that already support the token—including MEXC, Gate.io, SushiSwap and RCP Swap—its size has given some Reddit users reason to be especially bullish. “It gets serious,” posted one user.  Today’s listing has sparked a frenzy on the already buzzing cryptocurrency subreddit (r/Cryptocurrency), which is home to over 6.5 million users. “Crypto.com suddenly becomes the default for millions of Redditors,” said one post.  Others claimed that they were genuinely surprised, writing, “Did anyone else not expect to make it this far? Like I don't know what to do, I didn't plan for this.”"
Vitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Plans to Make Crypto Wallets as Simple as Email,"Modern account abstraction is “really elegant” because it doesn’t require changes to the underlying protocol like other upgrades before it, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Paris. Developers have been working on account abstraction, or different iterations of it, since 2015, even before Ethereum was launched. The idea is to switch from Externally Owned Wallets, or EOAs, to smart contract-based wallets. If they pull it off, managing a crypto wallet would become as easy as managing an email account. That would mean users could potentially recover their seed phrase—the private key used to sign trasnactions—as easily as they can reset the password on an email account. The latest version is EIP-4337 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4337), also known as Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool. The Ethereum (ETH) upgrade would allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. This would unlock a number of features, such as easy wallet recovery, signless transactions–which translates into lower transaction fees–and team wallets (also known as multisignature wallets). According to Buterin, the upgrade could be one of the driving catalysts for Web3 adoption around the world. “One of the key properties we want blockchains to have is that they give you money before you register,” he said."
Asset Managers Back Bitcoin But Hold More Ethereum in CoinShares Poll,"Bitcoin has been tapped as the cryptocurrency with the most compelling growth outlook in a CoinShares poll of prominent asset managers—but Ether continues to hold the largest position in their portfolios. A total of 51 investors who collectively have $900 billion in assets under management took part in the quarterly survey, with 43% declaring that BTC's upside potential is superior to ETH. But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's aggressive stance against this still-nascent sector is still weighing heavily on family offices, institutions, and wealth managers—with growing concerns that tighter regulation, and even an outright ban, pose key risks to crypto in the future. The news wasn't all bad. Despite the spectacular implosions seen at FTX and Three Arrows Capital, reputational damage is no longer seen as a stumbling block for institutional investors looking to gain exposure to digital assets. A banking crisis and an appetite to diversify are the catalysts here—but there's little doubt that public enthusiasm from the world's largest asset manager has had a dramatic impact on sentiment. CoinShares' figures suggest there's been a substantial contraction in the weighting given to digital assets within portfolios—shrinking from 1.8% in April to 0.7% by the end of June. And to make matters worse, $400 million of outflows were recorded in the first half of 2023. "
1inch Token Hits 3-Month High Amid Surge in South Korean Trading Volumes,"The crypto market's top gainer this morning was the token powering the 1inch Network, which saw a significant overnight gain of 19%. The governance token of the decentralized exchange aggregator has been on a tear since July 14, with a weekly increase of 67%. In comparison, the rest of the market stayed relatively quiet with minimal movements over the weekend as Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow range between $30,150 and $30,500. Ethereum (ETH) traded in a further smaller range between $1,920 and $1,945 since Friday. The latest rally comes amid a hefty uptick in trading volume in South Korea, an anomaly witnessed during the price surge of both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Aptos (APT) in the last two weeks."
Crypto Exchange Binance Finalizes Bitcoin Lightning Network Integration,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume, today announced it has completed its integration of the Lightning Network, the popular scaling solution running atop the Bitcoin blockchain. Binance users can now use the Layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits, the company said in a Monday announcement. To make use of the new feature, users need to select the “BTC-Lightning” as their network when depositing or withdrawing Bitcoin from the exchange. The integration comes after Binance confirmed last month that it was in the process of incorporating Lightning nodes into its infrastructure. The intention to enable Lightning withdrawals was initially disclosed by the exchange in May, following a period of heightened congestion on the Bitcoin network that led Binance to temporarily suspend BTC withdrawals. #Binance has completed the integration of Bitcoin ( #BTC ) on the Lightning Network and deposits and withdrawals are now open.

Over 200 Ethscriptions Nabbed in Smart Contract Exploit,"A new protocol that lets people create and share digital objects on Ethereum has hit a major setback, according to its creator, who said the Ethscriptions main marketplace had been hacked. Launched last month by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, Ethscriptions is a novel way to create Ethereum assets that leverage transaction “calldata” to write non-financial data to the network’s blockchain.  The Ethscriptions’ protocol itself and other applications that tap the technology haven’t been impacted, Lehman said. Yet, a sizable number of Ethscriptions listed on Ethscriptions.com have been stolen, Lehman said on Twitter on Friday.  “About 123 individual addresses lost a total of about 202 ethscriptions in this exploit,” he said. “Any young protocol will have bumpy landings, but this is definitely not what I meant.” https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS Marketplace Security Incident Update"
"Brazilian CBDC Allows Government to Freeze Funds, Developer Finds","A blockchain developer has reverse-engineered the code behind the Brazilian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and discovered an unsettling feature: the government has built in the ability to freeze funds and adjust balances. Pedro Magalhaes, founder of Web3 consulting company Iora Labs, reviewed the Application Programming Interface published by the monetary authority on its Github account. And he says the government has not been forthcoming with an explanation. “They tend to keep things closed off and usually don’t communicate with non-bankers,"" he told Decrypt, although he said he has had some general discussions on Github about the CBDC implementation. “Honestly, they don’t even need to care about public opinion.” Vini Barbosa, reporter for Brazilian crypto news outlet Portal Do Bitcoin, took to social media to claim thathe spoke to the Brazilian authorities and confirmed Magalhaes’ findings.  “The ability to 'freeze or arrest amounts' held in [this system] is protected by current legislation in Brazil, according to the Central Bank,"" Barbosa tweeted."
"This Week on Crypto Twitter: XRP Scores Courtroom Victory Against SEC, Cryptoverse Explodes","The firestorm was first kindled when an obscure crypto intelligence firm called Arkham tweeted that it was opening an intelligence exchange where people could post bounties to incentivize blockchain analysts to identify the people or companies behind any wallet or transaction.

SEC Formally Accepts BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Application for Review,"BlackRock's application to offer a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been added to the official docket of the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its proposed rule change process. The move, recorded late Thursday, advances the most closely-watched Bitcoin-related proposal to the SEC to date. The application for the iShares Bitcoin Trust was filed nearly a month ago, prompting a new wave of optimism across the crypto market, and additional filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs from a number of other prominent players, including from firms like Invesco, Wisdom Tree, Bitwise, and Fidelity—which saw its previous application rejected last year along with those from other contenders. When the SEC signaled last month that BlackRock's application was lacking, the company filed a revised application, adding a ""surveillance sharing"" clause that would involve the Coinbase crypto exchange monitoring and reporting possible illegal activity. Soon enough, Valkyrie updated its application with the same provision, as did Fidelity and ARK Invest. A spot Bitcoin ETF would track the value of Bitcoin without requiring the asset to be held directly. It would also be tradable on a traditional stock exchange."
Bitcoin Miners Face 'Stress Test' in Next Halving: JP Morgan,"Bitcoin miners will face headwinds as the hash rate reaches new record highs ahead of the upcoming halving event next spring, with volatile electricity costs and competition among miners pushing up the cost of production, according to analysts at global financial giant JP Morgan. Hash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, will reduce miners' rewards by half. ""The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners,"" writes JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and colleagues in the firm's latest Flows and Liquidity report, which the firm shared with Decrypt. ""[It] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners’ revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin’s production cost at the same time,"" the report explains. ""As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners."" According to the analysis, and based on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, which is currently worth around $30,000, per CoinGecko. But JP Morgan said the volatility of the hash rate points to the use of a variety of energy sources, meaning miners with access to lower-priced power have an advantage."
"This Week in Coins: XRP Leads Alt Week as Solana, Cardano and Polygon Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum","It was a week of altcoin rallies after Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC, and details of an upcoming Polygon 2.0 rollout shifted attention away from the two market leaders.  Bitcoin (BTC) still gained in value, a modest 3%, and currently changes hands at $30,287, according to CoinGecko.  On Monday, reports hit the press that the British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 before 2025. It wasn’t quite enough to boost the price of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization this week, though.  Ethereum (ETH) fared substantially better, though not in the same league as the altcoins. It rose 6.6% to trade at $2,001 at the start of the weekend—$1,932 as of this writing. On Thursday, Ethereum hit $2,000 for the first time since May.  While the latest CPI report, released on Wednesday, indicates that U.S. inflation is going down in line with expectations, it wasn’t quite enough to send investors toward the two most popular cryptocurrencies."
"Ethereum Hits $2,000 for First Time Since May Following XRP Ruling","The broader cryptocurrency market is showing green almost across the board today following a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that XRP should not be considered a security in certain contexts. That momentum has propelled Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, over $2,000 for the first time in over two months. Ethereum traded as high as $2,009 this afternoon, per data from CoinGecko, but has dipped slightly to a current price of $1,985 as of this writing. That’s a 5% rise over the past 24 hours, and a 14% gain over the last month. The last time that Ethereum traded above $2,000 was on May 5, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum briefly popped above $2,100 in April, but other than those two brief time periods, ETH has remained under the $2,000 threshold over the last 11 months. Even with today’s climb, Ethereum remains down 59% from its peak price point of $4,878 set at the peak of the cryptocurrency market in November 2021. Ethereum is far from the only cryptocurrency or token to benefit from the momentum generated by the XRP ruling, which has propelled XRP’s own price by 81% over the last 24 hours."
"Did XRP Restart Alt Season? Solana, Cardano, Polygon Up Double Digits","Following a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that XRP—the token powering the Ripple network—is not a security in certain contexts, a sea of green has emerged across popular altcoins, with top coins up double-digit percentages over the past 24 hours. XRP itself is up a colossal 62% as of writing upon the news–which has seen an uproar from the self-proclaimed “XRP army” all throughout Twitter—trading above $0.76, according to data from CoinGecko.  Select other altcoins, some of which were previously deemed securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have also benefited from the rising tide. Solana (SOL) has roared upwards with a 17% gain on the day, marking a sizable 32% increase on the week, changing hands at around $26, according to CoinGecko.  Ethereum scaling network Polygon (MATIC), which made news last week for a restructuring in its executive team, has also had a favorable day, notching an 16% gain, trading at $0.84 on the day—showcasing a bullish 27% candle on the week. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is changing hands above $0.32 on the day, which translates into a nearly 13% daily gain—along with Stellar Lumens (XLM), which has clocked a massive 35% gain on the day, currently trading above $0.13."
XRP Surges 29% on Judge's Ruling in Ripple SEC Case,"XRP, the cryptocurrency that fuels Ripple’s payments ecosystem, has spiked nearly 29% in less than an hour after word spread that a judge ruled in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple Labs. The price of XRP sits above $0.60 as of this writing, according to data from CoinGecko, marking a nearly 29% increase over the last 24 hours. Prior to the news, the coin was trading for about $0.47 over the past day. XRP hasn’t traded at $0.60 since May 2022, ahead of a market-wide plunge that affected the broader cryptocurrency space. The price of Ripple has also arguably been depressed by the ongoing legal challenge from the SEC. The impact of the ruling remains to be seen. The judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP do not qualify as securities, but institutional sales of XRP do qualify the coin as a security. That potentially opens the doors to a new paradigm in which the way a cryptocurrency is sold—and the marketing and messaging tied to it—may dictate whether it qualifies as a security."
Claude 2 Is Out—How Does Anthropic’s AI Chatbot Compare to ChatGPT and Google Bard?,"Anthropic, the AI firm launched by former OpenAI researchers, has unveiled its updated chatbot, Claude 2, setting its sights squarely on rivals like ChatGPT and Google Bard. Coming a mere five months after the debut of Claude, its successor boasts longer responses, nuanced reasoning, and superior performance, scoring impressively in the GRE reading and writing exams. Claude 2 has been characterized as an AI powerhouse capable of digesting up to 100,000 tokens, roughly equivalent to 75,000 words, in a single prompt. This is a dramatic leap from Claude's previous 9,000 token limit, which presents a unique advantage: the AI's ability to provide responses in a more contextual and improved manner. The new model has made significant strides in multiple fields, including law, mathematics, and coding, assessed via standardized testing. According to Anthropic, Claude 2 scored 76.5% in the Bar exam's multiple-choice section (GPT-3.5 achieved 50.3%) and achieved a score higher than 90% of graduate school applicants in GRE reading and writing exams. Claude 2 also scored a 71.2% on the Codex HumanEval Python coding test and an 88.0% on GSM8k grade-school math problems, revealing its advanced computational skills. As reported by Decrypt, Anthropic’s Claude is designed with a unique ""constitution,"" a set of rules inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enables it to self-improve without human feedback, identify improper behavior, and adapt its own conduct."
Bitcoin Has Formed a 'Firm Foundation' Under $30000: Glassnode,"Bitcoin’s supply distribution shows a “firm foundation of investor holdings” below $30,000, suggesting strong price support for its current level, according to the on-chain analytics platform Glassnode. In a report published on Monday, the firm noted how the ratio of coins in profit/loss has reached 75:25, meaning that just one-quarter of all coins were bought above Bitcoin’s current price of about $30,000. Virtually all members of that cohort are long-term holders who “are either battle-hardened HODLers, or “likely to create resistance” by taking profits as the price rises, the firm explained.. “We can see that the supply cluster between $15K and $30K is quite significant, demonstrating that a large volume of coins changed hands over the last 12 months,” noted Glassnode. “Conversely, just 25% of the supply was acquired at prices above $30k, held by buyers from the 2021-22 cycle.” For Bitcoin, the 75:25 ratio represents an “equilibrium point” where 50% of all trading days have seen a higher profit/loss balance, and vice versa. According to Glassnode, the market usually takes time to digest this level once it is reached, with analysts referring to this time as an “accumulation period” between halving events."
FTX Exec Investigated for Illegal Donations to Girlfriend's Congressional Campaign: WSJ,"An executive from the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX is under investigation for allegedly making illegal donations to his girlfriend’s political campaign, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining a series of donations by former FTX executive Ryan Salame to his then-girlfriend Michelle Bond during her bid to win the Republican nomination for a congressional district on Long Island. Specifically, they are looking at money transferred from Salame to Bond, as well as loans the candidate made to her own campaign.  Bond, whose run was supported by prominent conservatives, received just over $56,000 in donations from Salame and other FTX employees, according to Federal Election Commission records. In total, Bond received over $659,000 in contributions for her campaign in 2022.  A representative for Salame did not return a request for comment from Decrypt. "
"MATIC Soars 9% Ahead of Polygon 2.0 Rollout, Rebounding Network Growth","Polygon (MATIC) is up 8.5% on the day amid positive on-chain growth, reduced selling pressure, and improved regulatory outlook. MATIC plummeted at the start of June after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarded it as a security in the case filing against Coinbase and Binance. The token’s price plummeted 35.5% from $0.90 on Jun 3 to lows of 0.59 within two weeks following SEC’s case. Nevertheless, the blockchain’s on-chain data shows that selling has slowed alongside an uptick in activity. The appointment of their legal head Marc Boiron as CEO appears to have acted as a positive catalyst for the price, bogged down by regulatory concerns."
Daily Ordinals Inscriptions Approach All-Time High as Bitcoin Fees Remain Low,"Bitcoin Ordinals continue their relentless takeover of the network–nearing the all-time high for daily inscriptions, whilst maintaining low fees.  There was an impressive surge in activity over the weekend, according to crypto data provider Dune, with Sunday clocking the second-busiest day in Ordinal history, registering 385,920 inscriptions. The number is slightly below the number one placeholder, May 7 (also a weekend), which saw over 400,000 inscriptions.  Even so, Bitcoin transaction fees have remained low after their May highs, according to Dune’s Ordinal dashboard. Sunday, which saw the spike in inscription activity, only notched 2.5 BTC in fees. Indeed, given the parabolic rise in inscriptions—which currently number 16,299,730—and the social madness that ensued, fees have actually been consistently low over the past weeks. Users haven’t paid more than 3 BTC a day during the month of July, and the network hasn’t seen a daily fee count surpass 10 Bitcoin since May 31.  That is a significant difference from the previous occasion in which the network neared or reached 400,000 inscriptions. In early May, a fierce debate was triggered after a bloated Bitcoin network was charging triple-digit fees for transactions. Users on May 7 paid 247 Bitcoin in fees—marking a stunning 10,000% difference from this weekend."
ApeCoin Crashes to All-Time Low as Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Prices Sink,"In recent weeks, pressure in the NFT space has weighed on prominent collections of profile pictures (PFPs) like the Bored Ape Yacht Club. And that stress may have spilled over to ApeCoin (APE) too. The crypto token associated with Yuga Labs’ namesake collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs has fallen 15% over the past 14 days, scraping past an all-time low of $1.85 on Friday, according to CoinGecko. As the NFT market struggles to find its footing again, ApeCoin continues to decline. Bored Ape NFTs have recovered $10,000 from recent, multi-year lows in terms of floor price, or the price of the cheapest NFT listed for sale from a collection. But ApeCoin came within two cents short of a newfound bottom on Monday following Friday's fresh low. The Ethereum-based ApeCoin made its sizzling debut in March 2022, and not long after it launched, the simian-centered token surged to an all-time high of $26.70 in April. At that time, it reached a market cap of close to $7.6 billion dollars. ApeCoin is now down nearly 93% from that peak, as of this writing. Bored Ape NFTs hit a peak minimum price of $429,000 or 152 ETH that same month, bolstered by celebrity owners who bore Bored Apes as digital status symbols and visions of Yuga Labs’ ambitious Otherside metaverse game. Since then, Bored Ape prices have fallen as low as about $52,000 worth of ETH, on July 2."
"Bitcoin Will Reach $120K Before 2025, Standard Chartered Predicts","British multinational bank Standard Chartered has boosted its Bitcoin price forecast to $120,000 by the end of 2024—a 300% leap from where it is today. In a report viewed by Reuters, the bank predicted Bitcoin’s rise will be driven largely by miners hoarding their coins and cutting off additions to Bitcoin’s circulating supply. “Increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, one of Standard Chartered’s top FX analysts, in the report. Bitcoin is up 82% year to date, from $16,600 on January 1 to $30,280 at writing time. Since miners are rewarded with a fixed number of BTC (6.25) per block, such bullish price momentum has helped boost the industry’s revenue since the start of the year, reversing negative momentum amid declining revenue in 2022. The opposite trend was visible in June of 2022, when BTC's falling price forced major miners like Core Scientific and Riot to dump the vast majority of their coins on the market, only contributing to Bitcoin’s free fall to under $18,000."
Staked Ethereum Now Accounts for 20% of the Total Supply,"Just shy of $45 billion or 20% of Ethereum in circulation has been staked—a milestone reached on Monday that captures coins at work like never before.

PEPE Leads Meme Coin Losses as Fresh Token Launches Grab Trader’s Attention,"The largest meme coins by market capitalization in Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PepeCoin (PEPE) have been trading in the red since last week amid the rise of new competitors in the sector. Recent bearish moves from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) certainly haven’t helped either given their high correlation to the rest of the market. PEPE topped the losses among the top three meme coins, down 14.9% since last week and 5.5% in the last 24 hours. It’s currently trading at $0.00000144 with a market capitalization of $619 million. Still, on a 30-day scale, PEPE is up 52.5% after posting impressive triple-digit gains during June’s meme coin rally. The launch of copycat projects like PEPE 2.0 and Shib 2.0 captured the market’s attention last week."
Crypto Booster Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Bought Bitcoin Despite Recent Claim: Report,"Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, confirmed that he owns a considerable amount of Bitcoin—after saying he didn't, and after the crypto was initially atrributed to his wife. Even so, it’s not a conflict of interest, according to his campaign. Kennedy praised Bitcoin during a keynote address at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami in May, and said the network should be nurtured and protected. He also said that his campaign would accept donations in Bitcoin. But he also told conference-goers he was not an investor in Bitcoin, and that his endorsement of the asset did not amount to investment advice. However, a financial disclosure obtained by CNBC shows Kennedy’s family holds between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin in a brokerage account as of June 30. The filing, which does not state when the investment took place, says Kennedy’s family’s income from the purchase is less than $201. Kennedy’s campaign manager, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, told CNBC that a conflict of interest does not exist, and the purchase took place after Kennedy’s positive remarks regarding Bitcoin in Miami. Following the report's release, Kennedy’s campaign first told CNBC the Bitcoin belonged to Kennedy’s wife Cheryl Hines, who is known for  her work on the television show “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” A representative from Kennedy’s campaign later said that they were mistaken, and that the Bitcoin investment did indeed belong to Kennedy."
Ethereum Inventor Vitalik Buterin Has Advice for Bitcoiners,"“I think if we want Bitcoin to be more than payments, it needs more scaling solutions,” said Vitalik Buterin, on a Twitter Spaces this week, pointing to several experiments that Ethereum has been trying out over the past years. But the main problem, for him, is politics. “Bitcoin has really weird politics,” he said, adding that he “doesn’t vibe with them.” Over 32,000 people tuned in to listen as the Ethereum inventor talked with ""altcoin slayer"" Eric Wall and Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer about what Bitcoiners can learn from Ethereum. The trio tackled one of the main pain points of the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market cap: Bitcoin's slow transaction throughput, and thus the need for layer two scaling approaches to increase the speed at which people can send and receive the digital asset."
"This Week on Crypto Twitter: Winklevoss Calls on Silbert to Negotiate, Sues Him 3 Days Later","The prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum this week remained trapped in amber due to a dearth of both adoption or regulation stories.  The week also saw the launch of Meta’s Threads, an Instagram-based microblogging site that looks suspiciously like Twitter. Don’t expect to see This Week on Crypto Threads just yet, however. In spite of the mass onboarding (ten million users in a few hours), Twitter will probably remain the Cryptoverse’s platform of choice for the foreseeable future. The week began with a DAO hack that severely disrupted the NFT market. Azuki DAO was formed by disgruntled Azuki NFT holders who banded together to coordinate a lawsuit demanding a $38 million refund from the Azuki’s creator, Chiru Labs, after its most recent release appeared to shamelessly plagiarize the original collection and do even better.  The DAO itself was exploited for tens of thousands of dollars and appeared to have a knock-on effect on Yuga Labs’s iconic blue chip Bored Ape and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT collections, tweeted blockchain journalist Colin Wu.  Affected by the Azuki incident, the NFT market fell sharply again in the past 24h. BAYC fell 16% and fell below 30 ETH, MAYC fell 20% and fell below 5 ETH, and Azuki fell 11% and fell below 6 ETH. The overall market value of the NFT market has fallen by 53% to 3.33million ETH in…"
This Week in Coins: Solana Surges as Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally Rebound,"Echoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.  Nonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF—a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly. The SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock’s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they'll integrate a ""surveillance-sharing agreement"" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity. BlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.  In another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday. "
Ethereum Core Dev Explains Why Proto-Danksharding Is a Big Deal,"Proto-danksharding is going to completely change Ethereum—and for the better, says core developer Mario Havel. At ETH Barcelona over the weekend, Havel told Decrypt that the next big Ethereum upgrade, dubbed ""Dencun,"" is nearing the ""final stages of planning."" The upgrade will do many things, but one of the major changes is the introduction of the proto-danksharding feature, which will allow the network to scale and handle up to 100,000 transaction per second, devs say. “The majority of the focus right now is on the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding,” Havel explained. According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type—the oddly named “data blob.” Blob blocks also introduce what’s called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it. According to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain “blobs” of information. That's helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as ""rollups"" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions."
Bitcoin BRC-20 Tokens Are Now Moving Over to Ethereum,"Six months after launching a protocol that lets people mint NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ordinals space is rapidly evolving. Not only are new products springing up one after another, but the Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens are now expanding onto none other than Ethereum, the dominant NFT and token ecosystem. Two of the largest BRC-20 tokens on the market, ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem—a tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge—to release BRC-20 Curated Collections. “This should be considered a day in which BRC-20s began exploring what their asset class is,” said Jake Gallen, who is in charge of NFT strategy and product at Emblem. ⬛️🟧 $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD 🟧⬛️ 🚀 VAULTING IS NOW LIVE 🚀"
"US Still 'Center of Gravity' for Crypto Industry, Says K33 Research","K33 Research, a division of the crypto brokerage firm by the same name, found that 30% of all crypto workers reside in the U.S., according to a new jobs report. And Andrews Helseth, vice president of K33 Research, said he expects it to stay that way. The report starts by sketching out the industry, which K33 says is comprised of 10,000 companies, employing 190,000 people, and has a valuation of $190 billion. Unsurprisingly, exchanges and brokerages employ the majority of those workers—approximately 60%, or 62,400 people. The next largest segment is financial services, with 48,500 jobs. The third place spot goes to blockchain analytics and mining firms registering nearly 40,000 employees, and last but not least are NFTs and gaming with 12,000 jobs. An “other” category is assigned 24,800 jobs, landing in fourth place. “There’s such a large number of firms who have between 5 and 15 employees,” Anders Helseth, vice president at K33 Research, told Decrypt. He said the number of people who work at those smaller crypto companies is striking. The report found that the Asia and Australia regions account for roughly 35% of the global crypto workforce. Leading the charge is, surprisingly, India. It has a 20% stronghold on the job market, overtaking China, most likely due to the country’s low salary requirements and strong competence, says K33."
CFTC Orders Two Florida Men to Pay $5.4 Million in Bitcoin Fraud Case,"Two Florida men accused of running a multi-million dollar Bitcoin scheme have been charged by and subsequently settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday. The U.S. derivatives market regulator charged Randy Craig Levine and Philip Reichenthal for engaging in digital asset fraud. The duo lied to investors and conned them out of over $5 million dollars meant to buy Bitcoin in 2018. The Commission ordered Reichenthal and Levine to pay around $5.4 million in restitution as part of the settlements, and both men were barred permanently from trading and registration with the CFTC. Reichenthal promised investors he would buy millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin from Levine, holding on to investors’ funds until a transaction could take place. Reichenthal posed as an escrow agent using his position as a licensed attorney, the agency said. But investors never saw a satoshi worth of Bitcoin. And that was according to the duo’s plan. When Reichenthal transferred funds to Levine, no Bitcoin ever traded hands or was disbursed. And investors’ funds were never returned."
Twitter Awarded Three State Money Transmitter Licenses,"As Twitter's most formidable competitor comes online, it also received regulatory approval from three U.S. states that serve a much broader vision for the social media company. New Hampshire, Michigan, and Missouri have approved Twitter's application to serve as a money transmitter, laying the groundwork for the social media app to expand into payments and other financial services. Money transmitter license requirements and the privileges they grant differ from state to state, but they generally allow a company to send, receive, and transfer funds for and among customers, both nationally and internationally. They also permit currency exchange—swapping foreign currencies for U.S. dollars, for example, and issuing prepaid cards. Ever since Elon Musk bought Twitter in late October last year, he hasn’t shied away from extolling his vision for the social media platform. He has said he wants to build a “WeChat for the West,” a platform that he has said he wants to copy, forming a “digital town” within which people can do pretty much everything they want—including making payments.  Dubbed “X, The Everything App,” the promised future app may or may not include cryptocurrency. While Musk had previously teased crypto integrations, plans appear to have changed after he assumed the top role, with a rumored wallet feature put on pause. "
"Threads Is Live, as Meta Launches Its Twitter Rival Early","Although the countdown showed nearly 14 hours left to go, the Threads app is now available for download from the Apple App Store and Google Play store for Android. The joy of publishing to a brand new social media timeline is palpable, as users flood into the Instagram-based spinoff. ""The Thread gates have opened,"" posted tech journalist Joanna Stern. ""Finally, people are liking my posts. They like me. They really like me!"" ""Who will be the first Threads main character?"" asked fellow tech scribe Taylor Lorenz. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said ""the last few days with you all have been really something special""—presumably referencing the users who could access Threads before it went public—and explained that the launch will take a little time."
Bitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million in Q2 Amid Ordinals Fervor,"Bitcoin miners are awash with funds from transaction fees, a multimillion-dollar windfall generated this past quarter due to the popularity of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals, according to Coin Metrics. The crypto analytics firm said that a formerly “tepid fee market” for Bitcoin miners has been suddenly upended, with its latest “State of the Network” report finding miners earning $184 million from transaction fees from April through June.  Compared to $2.4 billion in Bitcoin mining revenue overall, that figure may sound small, but the latest transaction fee total represents more than the five preceding quarters combined, Coin Metrics said. It described the shift as “an exceptional change” influenced by BRC-20 tokens. Launched earlier this year, Ordinals is a protocol that enables people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual satoshi—the smallest unit of currency that a Bitcoin can be divided into, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin.  Even though Ordinals’ arrival has been met with some pushback from within the Bitcoin community, its potential has been highlighted by figures like MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin supporter who noted the protocol’s new ability to help miners stay profitable over time."
Crypto Storage Token Storj Hits 10-Month High Overnight,"STORJ, the Ethereum-based token underpinning the eponymous decentralized cloud storage platform, soared to a ten-month high of $0.55 earlier on Wednesday, becoming one of the top-performing crypto assets in the past 24 hours. Although the price of STORJ is falling fast, trading at $0.41 at the time of this writing, it still represents a 16% increase on the day and a 67% rise over the last week. The last time STORJ changed hands at $0.55 levels was in September 2022, according to data from CoinGecko. A relatively small coin, STORJ at some point on Wednesday also saw its market cap almost double from yesterday's values below $39 million, moving the asset up to the 348th place in the rankings. While there’s no particular news or announcement that would trigger STORJ’s latest rally, the coin saw increased trading volumes on Upbit, one of the leading South Korean crypto exchanges, which contributed to over half of the entire spot trading volume for the token."
Does Ethereum Still Have a Cartel? Glassnode Unpacks Skyrocketing Staking,"Ethereum (ETH) staking has been flying high over the last several months after its latest upgrade, dubbed Shanghai, and the network has also seen the continued dominance of its so-called cartel, Lido Finance, according to the latest report by blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.  Some observers thought that the Shanghai upgrade in April—which allowed users to un-stake and withdraw their tokens—would mean a rush for the exits, Glassnode analysis shows that the opposite has happened.  According to Glassnode, daily staking deposits after Shanghai increased from 460 to 8,108 daily, registering an impressive spike on June 2, which saw 13,595 deposits. Last month, deposits for Ethereum averaged 2,267 a day. The biggest winner continues to be the aforementioned Lido Finance, which has sparked conspicuous conversations on Crypto Twitter due to its outsized footprint in the network’s staking pools–and the dangers that kind of centralization poses. Liquid staking refers to depositing Ethereum in a protocol that then pools it with other user deposits and then stakes the ETH on their behalf. In return, users get another token representing their staked position, which accumulates its own rewards. In Lido’s case, users receive Staked Ethereum, or stETH."

Aptos Jumps 10% Overnight as South Korea Trading Volumes Spike,"Aptos (APT) topped crypto market gains on Tuesday at 10% amid a surge in trading volumes in South Korea; the token was last trading at $8.15, per CoinGecko. Bitcoin's (BTC) positive price action above $31,000 yesterday has likely added to the positive sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) buyers are also attempting to move past resistance between $1,950 and $2,000. An anomaly in trading volumes might explain the latest APT price surge. Korean crypto exchange Upbit captured the maximum share of trading volume—nearly one-third of the total—in the last 24 hours, where APT was trading a premium. Upbit’s price was higher than the rest of the market by as much as 5%."
Now You Can Create Tunes via Bitcoin With an On-Chain Music Engine,"Inscribing artwork, games, and even meme tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain would have seemed unimaginable a year ago—but thanks to Ordinals, it’s all happening.

The “Descent Into Darkness Music Engine” was inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain on Saturday, with 10 editions minted and sold as individual Ordinals. By entering a few keywords, anyone—not just the owner of each inscription—can instantly generate a music track. Someone just inscribe a fully on-chain music engine onto Bitcoin using recursion! Type in any word or phrase to generate a unique on-chain song:"
Bitcoin Hits Its Highest Price in Over a Year,"Bitcoin notched its highest price in over a year on Monday, coasting upwards on news that BlackRock resubmitted its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The largest coin by market capitalization traded hands at $31,250 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. It represents a gain of 2.4% over the past day and Bitcoin’s highest price since June of last year. Over the past year, Bitcoin has risen 62%, navigating multiple crises like the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the historic blowup of several regional banks, eventually ending up in the green. Last June was one of Bitcoin's worst months since 2011, sliding as low as $19,000 from around $30,000. At that time, inflation in the U.S. peaked at a four-decade high of 9.1%, and the Federal Reserve ratcheted interest rates by 75 basis points, its largest hike in 28 years. Now, experts say BlackRock’s gambit to establish America’s first spot Bitcoin ETF is viewed as a hallmark of institutional adoption for crypto. Aside from bolstering Bitcoin’s reputation as an emerging asset, a spot ETF from BlackRock would make it easier for institutions to get exposure to crypto’s oldest coin."
"Bitcoin Tops $31,000, Ethereum Nears $2,000 as Crypto Rally Continues","Bitcoin's rally continued on Monday as the coin jumped back above $31,000 for the second time over the past week. The largest digital asset by market cap was trading for $31,052 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. That's a 1.8% 24-hour jump. The asset is also up over 2% in the past seven days, with a 17% gain over the past 14 days. Bitcoin first broke past $31,000—for the first time in over one year—two weeks ago thanks in part to renewed institutional investor interest. A high-profile Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from BlackRock and the launch of a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets were among the triggers, according to experts. Bitcoin dropped below that mark in recent days and was holding firmly above $30,000 per coin aside from a brief dip on Friday. But the price is now comfortably above $31,000 again. Investment firm CoinShares said on Monday that institutional investors are continuing to plug money into digital asset products, with $125 million worth of inflows over the past week. And most of that money is focused on Bitcoin, it added."
This Week on Crypto Twitter: Brian Armstrong and Jack Dorsey Blast Apple’s App Store Crypto Clampdown,"It was a relatively quiet week in the cryptoverse. The most significant bit of adoption news came from Buckingham Palace on Thursday when British King Charles signed his assent to a reform bill that now recognizes crypto trading as a regulated activity. Similarly, European parliamentarians announced their own crypto-focused regulatory reforms.

More attention was given to Apple’s removal of decentralized social networking app Damus from the App Store. Apple had given Damus a fortnight to remove its Bitcoin tipping feature (via the Layer 2 Lightning Network) and bring the app into compliance by integrating it with Apple’s own in-house payments mechanism."
"This Week In Coins: Bitcoin Unmoved, But Proof-of-Work Classics Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin Moon","Market leader Bitcoin had a wobbly week this week. It peaked above $31,100 and bottomed below $29,900, but its variability was limited to less than 2% in any given 24-hour period. After surpassing 50% market dominance last week, the top cryptocurrency settled back to 47.9%, but still sustaining over $9 billion in trading volume. Despite this ultimately flat week, Bitcoin (BTC) is up 15% over the last two weeks and up 13% over the last month, with a one-year return of more than 50%, according to data from CoinGecko. It currently trades for $30,612, which is more or less where it was seven days ago.   The number one contender, Ethereum (ETH), added 1.9% over the seven days to trade at $1,923 on Saturday.  Earlier in the week, several altcoins that had been labeled as securities by the SEC in its various lawsuits on the industry appeared to finally shake off the effects of the bad press. Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA) remain virtually unchanged from last week, but Solana (SOL) actually rallied and added 10% to change hands at $18.35. "
Hong Kong Is 'Embracing' Web3 With New Task Force,"Authorities in Hong Kong announced the creation of a task force dedicated to promoting Web3 development. The news broke late Friday, via an official press release from the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, for an initiative taking effect today. The group will have a two-year period to do its work, and is led by Hong Kong’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, along with other government officials and regulators. The task force also includes 15 non-official members, which include several industry experts. The territory’s financial secretary, Chan has been notoriously pro-crypto, with claims earlier this year that Hong Kong needs to seize the “golden opportunity” that Web3 presents.  “The blockchain technology underpinning Web3 features characteristics in respect of disintermediation, security, transparency, and low cost,”  he said in the announcement. “It has the potential to solve many difficulties and pain points encountered in finance, trade, business operations and even day-to-day life.” Hong Kong has been vying to become a Web3 leader for years, announcing an official policy statement on Virtual Assets in 2022. That policy, according to yesterday’s press release, received a positive response from the markets, which ultimately led to the creation of the task force, which will be entrusted with providing recommendations for a sustainable and responsible development of Web3 in the region. "
"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 33.9% in 24 Hours on EDX Listing, S. Korean Trading Spike","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues its uptrend that started after its listing on Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp.,-backed EDX Markets on June 20. The BCH token is the highest weekly gainer in the top 300 tokens by market capitalization on CoinGecko, with 114.3% gains.  In comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) recorded 2.4% gains in the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) traded at par with last week’s price. The latest 33.9% gain in BCH’s price in the last 24 hours appears to be driven by excess negative bets in the derivatives market fueling an uptrend and heightened trading interest on a South Korean exchange. The EDX Markets exchange listing is considered by some to be a good proxy for the state of BCH's regulatory clearance. Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, deemed that the four crypto tokens listed on EDX Markets (Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin) were safe bets in terms of compliance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission."
"North Carolina Reps Suggest Adding Bitcoin, Gold to State Treasury","North Carolina lawmakers are considering investments in Bitcoin and gold as a way to bolster the southern state’s coffers, passing a bill on Wednesday that would fund a study digital assets and precious metals. Having cleared North Carolina’s House of Representatives, the bill now advances to the state’s Senate. If it's approved in the Senate, it would then need to be signed into law by Gov. Roy Cooper. It was introduced in April under the title “State Precious Metals Depository Study.” “This is step one to eventually try to protect our assets in North Carolina,” state Rep. Mark Brody, the Republican who sponsored the bill, told Decrypt. “A lot of folks in the cryptocurrency world, as well as the precious metal world, know [...] the U.S. government is consistently and knowledgeably devaluing its currency.” Under the bill, the state would assess how holding digital assets and precious metals could help the state’s General Fund—essentially, the state’s bank account—hedge against inflation, reduce portfolio volatility, and yield better returns over time. The bill highlights systematic credit risks as a potential reason to hold Bitcoin and gold. Part of the study would examine how the state could acquire digital assets and precious metals, hold them securely, and liquidate them. Another element would have the state assess whether a state-administered institution should be created to custody assets like Bitcoin and gold."
Bitcoin ETF Race: Ark Amends SEC Filing to Match BlackRock,"ARK Invest, one of the high-profile companies vying for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), has amended its SEC filing to add a surveillance-sharing agreement. The change occurred a week after BlackRock filed for its own spot Bitcoin ETF, which did include such an agreement. As ARK submitted its proposal to the SEC in April, nearly two months before BlackRock's application, today's revision could help ARK cross the finish line first.  According to today’s filing, the agreement—dubbed “Spot BTC SSA”—is between ARK, the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BZX Exchange, and a cryptocurrency platform. Which cryptocurrency trading platform it will be, however, was not disclosed.  A surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) refers to information that is shared with regulators in order to prevent potential market manipulation. This includes market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification. The SEC has been adamant that none of the applicants has proven that they can adequately protect investors against manipulative practices.  Previous rejected or pending applications had not included SSAs, which caught the notice of many when BlockRock included one in last week’s ETF filing. The $9 trillion dollar asset manager brought the buzz and the bulls back with its application last week. Whether the industry views it favorably because of its size, or due to the surveillance-sharing agreement, is a matter of speculation. "
"It’s A 'Forgone Conclusion' That Ethereum Is A Commodity, Says Joe Lubin","Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging legal war across the crypto space, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin isn’t breaking a sweat.  When asked about regulators potentially treating Ether (ETH) like a security, the Consensys CEO explained during a Tuesday interview with CNBC that the regulatory verdict on Ethereum is already in. “The SEC has spoken,” he said, referring to former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman’s 2018 speech on crypto securities and Ethereum. New documents have revealed that Hinman received multiple warnings from colleagues that the speech could confuse markets into thinking that the SEC had already deemed the asset a non-security. A security is a financial instrument often (but not always) associated with some kind of investment contract. A commodity, by contrast, is a basic or natural good, like gold, wheat, or cattle.  “The CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,” added Lubin."
TUSD Brags About Volume 'Milestone' After Stablecoin Depegs,"The team behind stablecoin issuer TrueUSD is bragging about its trading volume not long after TUSD lost its peg to the dollar, fueling the fears of coin holders who are worried about the recent collapse of key TUSD custodian Prime Trust. During early trading hours on Wednesday, TUSD’s value fell to 80 cents to one USD on Binance US before settling around 90 cents to the dollar at the time of writing. Its total market capitalization stayed steady through the early hours before dropping sharply, shedding close to $100 million along the way, according to data from CoinGecko. Of this $100 million, the bulk of it came from a single wallet on the decentralized blockchain Tron. This wallet dumped nearly $74 million in TUSD, according to the blockchain analysis site Whale Alert. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose price is pegged to a stable asset, which in this case is the US dollar. Its appeal for holders is a sense of confidence that they can redeem their stablecoins reliably with a lower chance of losing their value compared to other cryptocurrencies.  After news hit that TUSD was depegged, TrueUSD responded on Twitter by touting its trading volumes. Without addressing the depegging, the issuer highlighted data that showed 30-day trading volume of TUSD. It finished its tweet with a fresh hashtag it called #TUSDKeepGrowing."
Bitcoin Market Dominance Reaches 58%—Highest Level Since April 2021,"Bitcoin’s relative percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has hit 58%, its highest level since April 2021, according to a new report from Coin Metrics.  With a staggering $590 billion market capitalization, the world’s leading cryptocurrency currently has further pushed back on Ethereum and smaller altcoins. The total market cap for the industry sits at $1.2 trillion according to Coingecko. This comes amid news of heightened regulatory scrutiny by U.S. regulators–who recently claimed a handful of cryptocurrencies were unregulated securities, causing several to shed billions off their market capitalizations. Bitcoin has been leading a bullish rally over the past week, after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Wall Street colossus sparked Bitcoin’s rise in crypto market dominance and triggered investors to buy the asset—despite many previously denied ETF applications. The price boost has also spilled over into other assets, such as Grayscales Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The so-called “GBTC discount,” which refers to the difference between the price of the shares and the net asset value (NAV) of the Bitcoin it holds, continues to drop, hitting a monthly low of -30%, according to YCharts."

"Blur, Pepe Lead Altcoin Action as Bitcoin Settles Above $30K","As Bitcoin stays above the $30,000 mark, a number of usually quiet altcoins are surging. In the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows that NFT marketplace and aggregator Blur's native BLUR token is up more than 11%. Blur, which launched an airdrop in February, is the the largest recent rival to market leader OpenSea. In the past week, it is up 15%, trading for $0.39. Other alts experiencing a surge include the new meme coin Pepe, which launched in April and is based on the Pepe the Frog internet meme. It's up modestly by nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, trading for $0.00000162. But compared to the past week it's a winner—having surged by 74% in the past seven days. Also up significantly is Flex Coin, the native token of crypto exchange CoinFLEX: it's up over 21% in 24 hours and 62% in the past seven days."

"Bitcoin, Tech Stock Correlation Hits Three-Year Low","Bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have hit their lowest correlation in three years, indicating a possible decoupling is in the works, according to a new report from Kaiko Research. Simultaneously, the cryptocurrency and gold hit the highest correlation in several years last week, with both assets rallying in 2023.  Kaiko, a financial markets data provider, reported that the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 collapsed to just 3%. The Nasdaq  tracks the performance of the largest and most actively-traded non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Meanwhile, the index's correlation with traditional risk assets has steadily weakened this year from an average of 60% in 2022. According to analysts, however, the Nasdaq 100 has technically entered a bull market, up more than 20% since its December 2022 lows. Dessislava Ianeva, research analyst at Kaiko, told Decrypt, “The main reason for the declining correlation is that Bitcoin has been largely impacted by crypto-specific events,” like the recent regulatory environment. She said this has not impacted tech equities to the same extent. “A lot of de-risking has already taken place last year with many institutional investors exiting the market,” Ianeva added, noting that this “means that these investors are not likely to sell both crypto and tech equities simultaneously.”"
"Weekly Inflows to Crypto Investment Products Hit $199M, Largest Since July 2022","Crypto-based investment products recorded their largest single weekly inflows since July 2022, according to European digital asset management firm CoinShares’ weekly fund report. Per CoinShares, total inflows across crypto-based investment products hit $199 million; Bitcoin led the pack with inflows of $187 million. The total assets under management in crypto investment products also reached a yearly high, surpassing $37 billion and erasing the losses since Three Arrows Capital shook the crypto market with its bankruptcy in July 2022. London-based ETC Issuance GmbH's Bitcoin exchange-traded product, BTCE, topped weekly inflows at $77.3 million. ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) saw the largest inflows in the U.S. at $60.4 million. Launched in October 2021, BITO tracks Bitcoin's price by strategically investing in CME Bitcoin Futures. Following last week's inflow, the fund surpassed $1 billion in total assets under management."
Hermès Cements Trademark Win Over 'MetaBirkin' NFTs with Permanent Ban,"A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday issued an order that permanently bars Mason Rothschild from selling his controversial MetaBirkins NFTs, granting one final request from the French luxury goods maker Hermés after the firm’s legal victory over Rothschild earlier this year. In February, a jury sided with Hermés, which had accused Rothschild of violating the company’s trademark for Birkin handbags with his line of 100 “MetaBirkins” NFTs—digital tokens tied to pictures of fur-covered, patterned handbags. “In effect, the jury found that Rothschild was simply a swindler,” Judge Jed Rakoff wrote in a filing. “Hermès proved that Rothschild intentionally misled consumers into believing that Hermès was backing its products.” Hemés was awarded $133,000 in damages, determining Rothschild’s NFT collection is not a form of protected free speech. The order delivered Friday also permanently enjoins Rothschild on several fronts, significantly restricting the future use of MetaBirkins. The order prevents Rothschild and associates from marketing, selling, and minting MetaBirkins NFTs, among other restrictions. It also prohibits Rothschild from making statements that could lead people to associate MetaBirkins with Hermés in the future."
This Week on Crypto Twitter: More BlackRock Banter as Ripple and Crypto.com Grow Globally,"From the market perspective, crypto’s biggest talking point this week was a carry over from last week: top investment firm BlackRock’s decision to apply to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.  While the SEC has swatted away such proposals like flies for years, there’s a sense that this one’s different. It helps that BlackRock—the world’s largest asset manager with a whopping $9 trillion in assets under management—has applied for 576 ETFs and has only been rejected once.  That air of experience and confidence helped propel the price of Bitcoin to a one-year high this weekend. Footage of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made the rounds, in which he explains just how much of a PR boost his company’s Bitcoin pivot is.  $10 TRILLION Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink: We got 3,000 hits on our website for monetary policy, and 600,000 hits on #Bitcoin "

SEC Approves First Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Friday. Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) is scheduled to launch on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BZX Exchange next Tuesday, June 27. According to the SEC filing, BITX “seeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.” An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, bundles securities like stocks and commodities. Investors can buy shares of an ETF to gain exposure to those securities without owning them directly. In the case of Bitcoin ETFs, there have been two main types: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot. The BITX fund will be a leveraged ETF. Leveraged funds use debt or financial derivatives—in this case, Bitcoin futures—as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index. That leverage can mean short-term gains for investors, but it can also lead to big losses. Today’s news was mostly lauded by cryptocurrency advocates across the market, however it does leave space for some questions."
Bitcoin Startup Casa Expands Beyond BTC With Ethereum Vaults,"No longer a Bitcoin-only company, today Bitcoin wallet provider Casa released Ethereum vaults, aimed at giving ETH holders a more secure way of take control of their funds. As the common refrain in crypto goes, ""Not your keys, not your coins."" Casa tries to make it easier and more secure for users to store their own funds via self-custody, rather than trust a third-party exchange with their funds. Now they’re allowing users to store Ethereum too, partly because so many Bitcoin owners also own ETH. Casa pointed to a 2021 survey from Grayscale Investments, which found that 87 percent of Bitcoin investors own at least one other cryptocurrency. The firm first announced plans to expand to Ethereum last November. 💫 Your ethereum multi-key vault has arrived! 🔒 Now, you can secure your $ETH without worrying about single points of failure like thefts, hacks, and accidents."
Bitcoin Breaks $28K for the First Time Since May,"The price of Bitcoin broke above $28,000 on Tuesday, the first time the number one cryptocurrency has done so since May 8, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 5.23% with a price of $28,144 per coin, with a high of $28,211 for the day.  Bitcoin's market capitalization rose 50% on Monday after news broke of the world's largest asset management firm BlackRock filing a new Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) this coming Thursday. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw a 12% bump after the BlackRock news surfaced. It's been a busy spring for Bitcoin, after largely recovering from the broad market collapse following the FTX debacle at the start of the year and with the explosive popularity of Ordinals. But the overall cryptocurrency market has otherwise slumped thanks to recent actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission towards giant cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Still, the news of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has revived hope that a Bitcoin ETF will finally be approved. No stranger to the crypto market, BlackRock has been working with Coinbase, which BlackRock would use to custody the ETF. In 2022, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to launch an investment management platform dubbed Aladdin for trading digital assets."
"The Metaverse is Coming to Bitcoin, Declares Bitmap Theory","Bitcoin Ordinals continue to inspire new products to enter the market. The latest entrant is dubbed Bitmap Theory, an innovative–and exciting–way to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and the metaverse.  Much like Ordinals, which allows users to permanently inscribe individual satoshis (the minimal unit of account in a bitcoin), Bitmap offers a way for individuals to claim ownership over Bitcoin blocks. According to its pseudonymous creator, Bitoshi Blockamoto, the open-source standard could integrate any block into a part of the metaverse.  “Bitmap is a revolution. You can now claim ownership of blocks on Bitcoin,” tweeted Blockamoto. “That’s prime real estate on digital gold.” The idea, Blockamoto said, is that not only can any Bitcoin block be inscribed, but platforms can also parse this data into the 3D realm, allowing for owners to distribute fractionalized transactions to others. This translates into users building on top of Bitcoin blocks, becoming contributors to the metaverse, and ultimately creating a vibrant community-driven space.  Announced June 13, Bitmap Theory has already sparked an inscription frenzy in the Ordinal community over the past week, with some rushing to grab historic blocks, like the first mined by Binance, or a block that contains Silk Road transactions. "
Bitcoin Reclaims Over 50% Market Dominance Following BlackRock ETF Filing,"Bitcoin’s market capitalization is once again larger than that of all other cryptocurrencies combined, according to data from TradingView.  The site’s BTC dominance metric rose above 50% on Monday for the first time since May 2021, when Bitcoin’s price plummeted after China announced a total ban on crypto mining, and Tesla partly distanced itself from the asset over environmental concerns.  WATCH: The exact moment Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) on Trading View crosses 50% for the first time in over 2 years pic.twitter.com/VQoKtZ71cY — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 19, 2023 "
Ordinals Brought Inscriptions to Bitcoin—Now Ethscriptions Land on Ethereum,"There is a new protocol that allows users to create and share digital objects on Ethereum. They are called Ethscriptions—an apparent tip of the hat to Inscriptions, a similar project by Ordinals deployed on the Bitcoin network. Developed by Tom Lehman, co-founder and former CEO of Genius.com, the project launched on Saturday and saw explosive interest. Nearly 30,000 Ethscriptions were created in less than 18 hours, according to Lehman, who tweeted that the launch was a “huge success.” Ethscriptions enable non-financial and arbitrary data to be written into the main Ethereum blockchain. Users can inscribe any type of file provided it is under 96 kilobytes in size. According to its creator, however, it currently only allows for images—but that will change in the future.  These inscriptions leverage what’s known as Ethereum “calldata,” which refers to the data provided within a call made to a smart contract. According to Lehman, the protocol is cheaper and more decentralized than using contract storage.  The [protocol] “guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions,” the creator tweeted, saying that “it's skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world.”"
Crypto Sleuth ZachXBT Receives Over $1 Million in Donations Following Defamation Lawsuit,"Days after ZachXBT, a widely respected blockchain sleuth, disclosed a defamation lawsuit related to one of his previous investigations, the volunteer crypto snoop has inspired over $1 million in donations from across the crypto community to help fund his legal defense. ZachXBT posted a digital wallet address on Twitter on Friday, alongside comments describing the lawsuit brought by Jeffrey Huang, a Tawainese-American musician and tech entrepreneur, as troubling and a “David and Goliath story.” Also known as Machi Big Brother online, Huang is suing ZachXBT over an article posted a year ago, in which ZachXBT accuses Huang of embezzling millions of dollars worth of Ethereum from Formosa Financial, a defunct crypto treasury management platform co-founded by Huang. ZachXBT’s claims were backed by on-chain data. “My understanding is that Machi is very wealthy. I am not,” ZachXBT said. “He is using his money to try [to] silence me.” ZachXBT said his legal defense could easily cost him more than $1 million, and, within a day, the wallet posted by ZachXBT has accumulated digital assets beyond that goal, consisting largely of stablecoins, according to Nansen Portfolio."
This Week on Crypto Twitter: The SEC Registration Hallucination,"Crypto markets recovered a tad this week on news that U.S. inflation appears to have cooled off. General clamor continued on Twitter over the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crackdown of the sector, in which the regulator filed two high-profile lawsuits against exchange titans Coinbase and Binance last week.  On Monday, Fox journalist Eleanor Terrett shared a transcription of remarks by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who maintains that cryptocurrencies can be regulated under existing securities laws.  🚨NEW: @SECGov Chairman @GaryGensler’s remarks before the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & Fintech Conference.  “I disagree with the notion- and recent history disproves it -that crypto intermediary compliance isn't possible.” Full speech in link 👇🏼https://t.co/QCEsQ1Ar6Y pic.twitter.com/tAiwudaAmT"
This Week in Coins: Markets Recover as Inflation Cools Down,"Markets recovered from last week’s crash after readings this week showed that U.S. inflation cooled to 4%, more or less in line with expectations. On Wednesday, the Fed elected not to raise interest rates at a meeting for the first time in eighteen months. Leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways that day but appear to have made some gains entering the weekend.  Bitcoin posted a slight gain of 3% over the last seven days to trade at $26,428 on Saturday. Meanwhile, Ethereum lost 0.6% over the same period and now changes hands at $1,725.  Most leading cryptocurrencies actually posted nominal gains this week. Several rallied hard, including Filecoin (FIL), up 10.3% to $3.71, Cosmus Hub (ATOM) rallied 13.2% to $8.91, Uniswap (UNI) ballooned 14.4% to $4.54 and Polygon (MATIC) surged 9.2% to $0.616745. None of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market capitalization posted any notable losses, in spite of the fact that it was the second week of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s escalation of enforcement actions on the industry.  The week began with news that Binance was lawyering up. It hired George Canellos, a former co-director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to help defend itself against 13 civil charges from the securities regulator, including operating as an unlicensed securities exchange. "
A Look at the Reserve Statements That Tether Tried to Conceal,"The reserves backing USDT, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Tether, once included assets belonging to Chinese companies, documents from the New York Attorney General's Office revealed.  In documents obtained as part of the attorney general’s investigation into Tether in 2021, long-running suspicions that Tether’s USDT stablecoin was backed by Chinese securities were confirmed. According to an investigation by Bloomberg News in October 2021, Tether held billions in short-term loans to Chinese companies. These documents were first obtained from New York’s attorney general following a freedom of information request filed by CoinDesk. Decrypt has also obtained a copy of those documents from the attorney general’s office.  Last July, Tether rejected claims that up to 85% of its commercial paper portfolio was backed by short-term debt issued by Chinese or Asian companies. The latest documents show that Tether did indeed rely on some Chinese securities to back USDT, including debt issued by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. According to the documents, Tether also held securities issued by other foreign businesses, including Deutsche Bank and Barclays Bank to support its reserves. "
Bitcoin Whale Moves $1.2 Million After 13 Years of Inactivity,"More than $1.2 million in Bitcoin that had not budged for over 13 years just moved.  A whale transferred the stash—50 BTC in total—to another wallet on Thursday, according to blockchain data.  The coins were mined back in June 2010 and had been sitting still ever since.  Previously untouched Bitcoin has been making movements lately: In April, a holder who hadn’t touched their coins for a decade moved $7.8 million-worth of Bitcoin to new wallets. Just days later, another long-term investor (or investors) moved $11 million in so-called digital gold after 11 years of inactivity. "
Miami's 'Bitcoin Mayor' Will Challenge Donald Trump for US President,"Francis X. Suarez, mayor of Miami, has filed to run for U.S. President. Known as the ""Bitcoin Mayor,"" Suarez has previously said he wants Miami to be a global crypto hub, personally investing in crypto in the wake of the passage of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, and pushed to receive his government paycheck and 401k benefit plan denominated in Bitcoin. Suarez filed as a Republican candidate today with the Federal Elections Commission, meaning he will be challenging former President Donald Trump for his party's nomination. Suarez joins a growing list of Republican presidential hopefuls looking to court the Bitcoin vote.  Florida Governor and candidate for the GOP nomination Ron DeSantis announced that the state would accept Bitcoin as payment from businesses for state taxes last year, although the announcement did not include individuals. Desantis also signed a bill banning Central Bank Digital Currency or CBDC in Florida in May.  During a TwitterSpaces conversation with then Twitter CEO Elon Musk, DeSantis said the future of Bitcoin depended on current U.S. President Joe Biden not being reelected."
"Bitcoin, Ethereum Trade Sideways as Fed Skips Rate Hike","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said its benchmark lending rate will stay put for now, electing to skip a rate hike during its latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting. For the past 18 months, traders have wondered when the Fed might flinch in its fight against inflation, watching with anticipation since the U.S. central bank lifted interest rates from near-zero last March—steadily putting pressure on the economy. “Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference on Wednesday. “Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.” The crypto market held steady following Powell's statements, with Bitcoin and Ethereum trading at roughly the same price over a 24-hour period. Much changed in the hours since the Fed's announcement, however. The price of Bitcoin has dropped sharply, losing 2.6% of its value in the last hour. Ethereum has fared even worse, falling by nearly 5% in the last hour. After an aggressive sequence of 10 rate hikes, the Fed’s benchmark interest rate currently stands between 5% and 5.25%. That means the rate, which dictates the interest banks and other depository institutions charge on short-term loans, is the highest it’s been since 2007."
Solana Hard Fork to Stave Off SEC? Devs Say It's Not Happening,"After last week’s aggressive regulatory action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which labeled Solana’s SOL token a security in a lawsuit, the community on Crypto Twitter erupted in a debate surrounding a possible hard fork. The debate, although it's been heated at times on Twitter, appears to not have reached Solana developers. “I work on the largest Solana project, with more than 10 developers, and nobody is discussing [a hard fork]” said Matías Kudelski, a cyber security researcher who audits Solana’s code and works on metaverse game Star Atlas. He spoke to Decrypt about the controversy on Monday and added that neither the Solana Foundation nor users in the protocol's Discord server had bothered weighing in on the possibility of a hard fork. The pseudonymous SOL whale known as ""HGE,"" a shareholder of NFT platforms Magic Eden, Tensor, and Exchange.Art, and a contributor to Hadeswap, an NFT automated market maker (AMM), spoke to Decrypt about the possibility of a hard fork."
"XRP Drops 5% as Markets Digest Hinman Documents, SEC Court Case","There’s been no rest for Ripple or the XRP token this week. Following the latest development in Ripple's court case with the SEC, XRP has plummeted 4.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. It's now trading at $0.50, five cents lower than when the Hinman documents were finally released yesterday. Ripple has been in a legal battle with the SEC, since 2020, due to allegedly selling unregistered securities. A vital element of the case is a 2018 speech by former SEC Director Bill Hinman stating that Ethereum (ETH) shouldn’t be considered a security as it was “sufficiently decentralized."" Ripple claimed that this speech caused confusion when they were sued for selling an unregistered security. The lawsuit alleges that since 2013, Ripple has raised $1.3 billion in XRP, a token that the Commission claims qualify as a security."
How Much Energy Does Bitcoin Really Use? Less Than You Might Think,"Crypto intelligence firm Coin Metrics released a report on Tuesday outlining how Bitcoin’s energy usage can be measured by scanning the blockchain for clues—linking activity on the network to specific, high-powered machines. For years, Bitcoin’s electricity usage has been a contentious topic, as critics point to the energy-intensive nature of validating transactions on proof-of-work networks. By continuously crunching complex calculations in hopes of solving Bitcoin’s next block, thousands of machines make guesses on networks like Bitcoin in hopes of a reward. As government organizations such as the White House put pressure on digital asset mining firms, mainly through its proposed 30% excise tax, the report aims to establish a more accurate approach to determining Bitcoin miners’ overall power consumption and builds on the methodologies of studies conducted by other institutions in the past. “Obviously, there's this massive debate about energy consumption,” the report’s lead author Karim Helmy told Decrypt in an interview. But one of the study’s other main motivations is capturing network-wide statistics that serve as a “really good reference value” for how competitive miners’ machines are, he said. By taking a closer look at data included in miners’ constant stream of guesses, researchers at Coin Metrics say they can better deduce Bitcoin's overall electricity consumption, matching up the “fingerprints” of each guess with the unique profile produced by certain machines."
"Bitcoin Will ‘10X’ With Regulatory Clarity, Says Michael Saylor","Faced with an onslaught of regulatory enforcement actions, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor believes the United States crypto industry is poised for a “Bitcoin-focused” future. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, the executive chairman of the business intelligence software firm claimed that recent declarations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are “laying the foundation” for the next Bitcoin bull run. “Regulatory clarity is going to drive Bitcoin adoption by eliminating the confusion and anxiety that has been holding back institutional investors,” said Saylor. Much of that confusion stems from other “crypto securities” for which regulators “don’t see a legitimate path forward” in the United States.  “They have a view of crypto exchanges which is far constrained,” he added. “Their view is crypto exchanges should trade and hold pure digital commodities like Bitcoin.” The SEC sued Coinbase—the largest crypto exchange in the US—last week, alleging that the company had listed over a dozen securities on its platform without registering as a securities exchange. The agency had generally been hesitant to comment on whether a specific token classifies as security until filing a lawsuit, for which it's been criticized by the industry and Congress alike. "
"Uniswap Update Means 'The Possibilities Are Pretty Endless,' Says Developer","Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the market, has announced Uniswap v4, bringing customizable features and releasing the draft core code so that the community can build on top of it. Sara Reynolds, lead smart contract engineer at Uniswap Labs, spoke to Decrypt about the upgrade. “The possibilities are pretty endless,” Reynolds said, adding that they are bringing v4 development into the open so the community “can take it anywhere.” Decentralized exchanges are platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without an intermediary. It enables swapping and holding tokens without users giving up self-custody. According to DefiLlama, Uniswap is the number one decentralized exchange on the market, with $3.87 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL)."
SUI Leads Crypto Market Rebound With 8% Rise Overnight,"Sui is soaring. The token behind Sui Network is up double digits on Tuesday as the wider crypto market looked to recover from the latest downturn. Last week, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took hefty action against the world’s largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The move shook markets, specifically tokens the Commission termed securities. Sui (SUI) led today’s gains with a 7.9% uptick amid a fresh tokenomics improvement proposal and a short squeeze of long orders in the futures market. Sui is a layer-1 blockchain layer built by former members of Facebook’s (now Meta) blockchain team with SUI as the native gas-paying and validating token of the network."
"Another Solo Bitcoin Miner Hits the Jackpot for $160,000","Third time’s the charm? For the third time since January, another solo Bitcoin miner struck digital gold, solving a block worth 6 BTC, or around $160,000. The independent miner solved a block that generally would take several years to do using limited processing power. Identified by the tag 151XTfHBfaDqoNWGGeYobNX2YzFFWuB5YD, the miner solved the 275th block of the Bitcoin blockchain on the Solo CKPool platform. Ck Pool admin Con Kolivas pointed out that it would take 450 years on average for a miner of this size to solve a Bitcoin block, beating 1:5,500 odds to do so as quickly as the minder did. According to Kolivas, the miner running a modest ~17 Terahashes per second (TH/s) is likely using a single S9 Bitmain Antminer unit. The S9 model Bitmain Antminer was released in 2017—the latest model, Antminer S19XP, in 2022. Congratulations to miner 151XTfHBfaDqoNWGGeYobNX2YzFFWuB5YD with only ~17TH for solving the 275th block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc! That is likely a single S9 miner. A miner of this size would only solve a block once every ~450 years on average https://t.co/1vGmN03qU6"
"Binance Suspends a Dozen Ethereum, BNB Token Trading Pairs","Binance halted trades across several Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) token pairs in the latest shake-up since the company was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Monday, the company said that it ended trading for more than a dozen pairs that involve its native BNB token, the defunct Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, and five involving ETH. The trades began to cease at 11:00 p.m. EST on Sunday and the rest were frozen by 4 a.m. EST Monday morning. Users on its international exchange were reminded that they can still trade in the currencies as part of other pairs on the platform, but were advised to cancel their Trading Bots before the removals were completed to avoid losses. A trading bot is an automated tool on Binance that can automatically run trades for users. Binance did not connect the announcements with any response to the SEC lawsuit, but it comes as the latest change affecting trading operations on the platform. Last Wednesday, Binance US eliminated more than forty crypto trading pairs, with the majority using the stablecoin Tether (USDT) as its pair. Other tokens paired with Bitcoin and BUSD were also impacted. Left untouched on the exchange were trades involving token pairs with Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC), among others that the SEC listed as unregistered securities in their lawsuit against Binance."
Gensyn AI Secures $43M for Decentralized Machine Learning Led by a16z,"Even though the focus of the tech industry has shifted to artificial intelligence, companies working in machine learning are still working to maximize the benefits of decentralized technology. UK-based Gensyn AI, which announced $43 million in Series A funding led by a16z crypto on Sunday, aims to empower developers to create AI tools on a pay-as-you-go model.  Gensyn was founded in 2020 by Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve. ""Essentially, Gensyn is a decentralized machine learning compute protocol,"" Gensyn AI co-founder Ben Fielding told Decrypt. The idea, Fielding said, is to connect all of the machine learning capable compute hardware in the world that is capable of doing machine learning training work—including GPUs and CPUs—and make it accessible to engineers, researchers, and academics. The biggest problem, Fielding said, is verifying that the computational task executed on the device has been executed properly."
"Solana, Cardano, Polygon Push Back Against SEC 'Security' Label","The organizations behind several popular cryptocurrencies have spoken out against recent claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—which argued that Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA) are securities. The SEC named the three among a slew of other tokens as examples of securities being offered and traded on allegedly non-compliant crypto exchanges as part of its lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase last week. Solana, Polygon, and Cardano are among the lawsuits’ most recognizable tokens, placing within the industry’s top 20 by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Combined, the three tokens have a market capitalization of over $21 billion—equal to around one-tenth of Ethereum’s total value. Over the past seven days, the trio of tokens have tumbled around 30% each, according to CoinGecko. Yet, as of this writing, they staged a partial comeback on Sunday—paring back a small portion of losses. Among the big three altcoins, Cardano was the first to have its regulatory status defended by a founding organization. On June 6, the blockchain research and engineering firm that created Cardano, Input Output Global (IOG), said ADA has never been a security under U.S. securities law."
Algorand and Flow Crash to All-Time Lows Following SEC Lawsuits,"Although the SEC took official action against the world's two largest exchanges, it also chose to name a number of cryptocurrencies that it describes as unregistered securities, triggering a drop across many altcoins. Two of them—Algorand (ALGO) and Flow (FLOW)—fell to all-time lows over the weekend. Their inclusion in the SEC's actions has called their regulatory status into question, along with many of crypto’s leading altcoins, like Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), which have also seen significant declines. On Saturday, Algorand and Flow traded hands at $0.098 and $0.459, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Both Algorand and Flow are down more than 60% from their respective $0.29 and $1.39 highs in February. Toppling more than 28% during a seven-day span, this week brought the lowest price in both coins’ histories. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance highlighted ALGO’s listing, and the agency’s lawsuit against Coinbase called to attention the availability of FLOW. Notably the organizations attached to each token aren’t named defendants in either lawsuit. Algorand was founded in 2017 by Silvio Micali, an award-winning computer scientist and professor at MIT, who designed the protocol as a speedy, scalable platform for building decentralized applications. Ranked 48th by market cap, the total value of Algorand’s native token, ALGO, is around $796 million."
This Week on Crypto Twitter: Outrage Over the SEC Crypto Crackdown,"Many leading cryptocurrencies plummeted in price this week after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission launched high-profile enforcement actions against cryptocurrency exchange titans Binance and Coinbase for allegedly violating securities laws.  The coins worst affected by the news were Solana, Polygon and Cardano, which were all labeled as securities offerings in the SEC’s Binance lawsuit.  Needless to say, it was a phenomenally busy week on the world’s favorite microblogging platform as people digested the news. Here’s how this pivotal week played out on Crypto Twitter.  On Monday, self-styled crypto sleuth @Leerzeit made an interesting observation. It should be noted here that former SEC director Bill Hinman in 2018 delivered a speech in which he explained his reasoning for why Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be considered securities.  The @SECGov has now removed Bill Hinman's biography from its website. Getting ready to throw him under the bus. pic.twitter.com/O7HCUGWSgt"
"Picking and Choosing Tokens to Prosecute Is 'Pretty Unfair,' Says Former SEC Cyber Chief","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led by Gary Gensler, has been clamping down big time on the cryptocurrency industry. This week it filed charges against Coinbase and Binance, the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, for violating U.S. securities laws—claimed some cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities, while others remained, puzzlingly, unmentioned. In fact, of the countless cryptocurrencies on the market, only a dozen or so have been called securities. Why is that? Robert Cohen, former SEC Cyber Chief spoke to Laura Shin on Unchained Podcast about the disparity. ""There is a seeming element of real bad luck and randomness, and getting singled out to be one of the 10 or 12 tokens that are mentioned when there's hundreds that could have been,” Cohen told the journalist and podcast host. ""When you think about a government taking action, that sort of randomness seems rather unfair."" ""If the SEC were passing rules, it affects everyone the same way, and people [should] have a chance to comment,” he added."
This Week in Coins: Market Crashes as SEC Slams Binance and Coinbase,"Crypto markets crashed hard this week on news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had launched enforcement actions against Binance on Monday, followed by Coinbase the next day—both sued for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges. The pair are the two largest crypto exchanges in the world—and the entire industry took notice. Market leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) sustained among the lighter losses among leading coins. Bitcoin depreciated by nearly 6% over the seven days to trade at $25,624 on Saturday. Ethereum fell 8.5% over the same period and currently changes hands at around $1,738.  Binance’s native BNB coin crashed 23% over the week to hit $236.  Huge losses of over 30% were felt by holders of Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). These three cryptocurrencies were all cited as securities in the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.  Leading cryptocurrencies that lost between 20% to 30% of their value this week include Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Uniswap (UNI), Chainlink (LINK), and Cosmus Hub (ATOM). "
"'Toxic Cocktail': EU Watchdog Calls Out Instagram, TikTok for Enabling Crypto Scams","Scammers are using social media to push cryptocurrency rackets? Tell us something we didn’t already know. Even so, the European Consumer Organization (BEUC) and nine of its member organizations have issued a stark warning to European authorities about the misleading promotion of cryptocurrency on leading social media platforms.  Beginning with a Dogecoin meme, the watchdog group's 20-page report categorically slams digital assets as highly risky and prone to scams. It outlines the effect that digital assets have on consumers, offering quantitative data on its usage across several nations, as well as how crypto influencers operate. In the report, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok are specifically called out, with the group calling the combination of social media networks, influencers, and cryptocurrency a “toxic cocktail.” The group claims that the networks' loose policies are “dubious,” and that scammers tend to target unsuspecting teenagers. It also emphasizes the role of “finfluencers” that make promises that are simply too good to be true. Today BEUC & consumer groups in 8 countries are taking action against TikTok, Instagram, Twitter & YouTube for facilitating the misleading promotion of crypto assets on social media 🪙.

A New Type of 'Social Token': PairedWorld Aims to Incentivize Real-World Connection,"A so-called “epidemic of loneliness” is sweeping through people, no doubt exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic—enough so that the U.S. Surgeon General recently called out the impact of isolation and deteriorating relationships on adults. Could Web3 somehow help reverse the trend and play a part in facilitating more real-world connections? That’s the aim of PairedWorld, a new crypto-fueled project developed by a collective of health experts and technologists. It aims to incentivize human bonds and interactions through a Web3 framework and associated Ethereum-based token, effectively putting a new kind of spin on the “social token” concept.  “The key to health and happiness boils down to one incredibly simple but profoundly powerful thing, and that’s good relationships,” Unpaired co-founder and CEO Raluca Cherciu tells Decrypt. Revealed at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) today in Lisbon, PairedWorld is driven by Unpaired—which is connected to the existing Party Degens NFT project—with help from Horizen Lab Ventures and NFT Studios. The creators say they aren’t trying to create a new community around PairedWorld, but rather “add value to existing communities and give them partial ownership of this new PairedWorld ecosystem,” explains Cherciu. “It’s an alliance.” "
The SEC Has Not Labeled Any Proof-of-Work Asset as a Security—Why Is That?,"As the onslaught from the SEC against crypto institutions like Binance and Coinbase continues, one distinction among the agency's targets has piqued the curiosity of industry watchers. Namely: Proof-of-Work (PoW) versus Proof-of-Stake (PoS) tokens.  While the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought charges against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges for unregistered securities offerings, they have also publicly declared which digital assets are in their sights, and which aren’t. “I think PoW coins are largely avoided because there is no central issuer,” Managing Director of Swan Bitcoin Steven Lubka told Decrypt. He explained that “generally speaking, PoW is an open mechanism and lacks a central issuer, unlike PoS coins.” According to the lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC considers the following to be securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL) and Sandbox (SAND) among several others.  What do they have in common? They are Proof-of-Stake coins, which refers to blockchains that require block validators to lock-up tokens in order to validate blocks. "
Tokens Bounce Back Across the Market After SEC Triggers Turmoil,"Cryptocurrencies are seeing green in the market today, after yesterday and today’s brutal governmental blows.  Bitcoin (BTC), the top crypto in the market, nearly erased yesterday’s losses, and is seeing a 3.7% increase on the day, trading hands at $27,055. On the week, however, the asset is down nearly 3%, with its market cap slightly above $520 billion.  Second in command of market cap, Ethereum (ETH), has seen a similar performance. It is up 3.6% in the last twenty-four hours, currently sitting at $1,874, according to Coingecko. The token has remained out of the Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC) list of securities, with a healthy market capitalization of over $225 billion.  Further down the list, various cryptocurrencies have seen similar price action, with mostly green candles among major and minor altcoins. This comes despite the SEC’s clampdown on what it considers to be unregulated securities.   Top ten tokens, also known as blue chips, are seeing gains within the 2-5% range, with outliers such as Dogecoin clocking a 6% increase, as it sits at #9 on Coingecko. "
PEPE Leads Market Losses Amid SEC Crackdown on Binance,"The total crypto market capitalization plummeted 3.6% overnight, per CoinGecko data, as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a fresh lawsuit against Binance. The lawsuit alleges that Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao failed to block U.S. users from accessing Binance.com, conducting the unregistered offer and sale of crypto, and operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing house. “We allege that Zhao and the Binance entities not only knew the rules of the road, but they also consciously chose to evade them and put their customers and investors at risk—all in an effort to maximize their own profits,” wrote Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a press release on Monday. Given Binance's size, hosting billions in traders across tens of millions of monthly users, the markets have sunk in reaction to the news. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) lost 4.2% and 3.1%, respectively. They last traded at $25,694 and $1,815."
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Silent on Bitcoin and CBDC During Twitter Talk with Elon Musk,"Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk hosted a conversation with presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr on Monday. And while it lasted for more than two hours, Bitcoin and the digital assets industry never came up. The chit-chat between the two, moderated by entrepreneur David Sacks, didn’t begin until 15 minutes after its scheduled start. The talk was not, however, overshadowed by technical issues that plagued Musk’s heart-to-heart with Ron DeSantis weeks ago. Kennedy, the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy, announced his 2024 presidential bid as a Democrat last month. And he has presented himself to potential voters as an outspoken advocate of Bitcoin. But Musk and Kennedy’s conversation focused on other tech topics, like artificial intelligence and social media censorship. They discussed calls for AI regulations, Musk’s Neuralink, and how COVID misinformation was handled on social media. On AI, Kennedy said, “If I do get in the White House, I think that's one of the things that I need to pay a lot of attention to,” adding it would need to be regulated in a way so that the tech “doesn't end up killing us all or enslaving us.”"
"SEC Claims Solana, Polygon, Cardano Are Securities in Binance Lawsuit","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unveiled a high-profile lawsuit against Binance on Monday, but a slew of altcoins like Solana and Polygon are also in the agency’s sights. Binance and the exchange’s CEO Changpeng Zhao were hit with 13 charges, accused of conduct like commingling customers’ funds and trying to evade U.S. securities laws with “sham controls” for determining who can do business with the firm. But the SEC also claimed that Solana, Polygon, Cardano, and several other coins are securities in the lawsuit. Almost all of them are among the crypto market’s largest, with multi-billion dollar market caps, while others belong to more nascent, gaming-centered projects.  The coins in question include Binance’s BNB token, the exchange's stablecoin, BUSD, and 10 other tokens: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI (COTI). While many tokens tanked immediately after the SEC’s enforcement action came to light, Solana was among those hit hardest as the lawsuit broke. The coin tumbled more than 6% to $20.14 in an hour, according to CoinGecko."
Is Ron DeSantis Right? Only 16% of Americans Support a CBDC in Latest Poll,"Only 16% of Americans said they favored a CBDC compared to 34% that opposed the technology’s adoption, according to the latest series of polls conducted by the Cato Institute. The libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., took the country’s temperature on a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Only a sliver of Americans support the notion of a digital dollar, and 49% of Americans surveyed said they had not developed a strong opinion either way. The institute noted that only 28% of the survey’s respondents were familiar with what CBDCs are. But the technology has gained growing attention within the crypto industry and on the 2024 campaign trail. Similar to stablecoins that are pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the greenback, CBDCs are a tokenized alternative to cash. But instead of being issued on decentralized networks by private companies, CBDCs are maintained by their respective governments or central banks. CBDCs have been critiqued within the crypto space for years, such as by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2021, who called them “cryptofascist currencies” with the potential to “casually annihilate” Americans’ savings. "
"This Week on Crypto Twitter: White House Mining Tax Scrapped, Bukele Hires Bitcoin Expert","Markets finally began to grow a little this week after four weeks of stagnation. There wasn’t a whole lot of news to drive prices either way. In the U.S., regulators continued to hold the line on their assertion that existing rules are sufficient for the industry. Meanwhile, another domestic crypto exchange—Gemini—continued expanding offshore. The most politically important tweet from Crypto Twitter this week came from Congressman Warren Davidson, who confirmed on Monday that the new U.S. debt ceiling agreement blocked an unpopular White House proposal for a 30% excise tax to be applied to crypto mining firms based on how much electricity they consume.  Yes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes. — Warren Davidson 🇺🇸 (@WarrenDavidson) May 29, 2023 "
