Library name: BeautifulSoup
Main features: 
1) BeautifulSoup's excellent support for encoding detection is a valuable feature that can yield better outputs for authentic HTML sites that do not fully disclose their encoding.
2) Beautiful Soup is built on well-known Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, enabling us to experiment with various parsing techniques or trade off speed for flexibility.
