# Library name: **BeautifulSoup**

# Main features: 
+ BeautifulSoup's excellent support for encoding detection is a valuable feature that can yield better outputs for authentic HTML sites that do not fully disclose their encoding. 
+ Beautiful Soup is built on well-known Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, enabling us to experiment with various parsing techniques or trade off speed for flexibility. 
# Pros of **BeautifulSoup**:
* The library helps in maintaining the code's simplicity and adaptability. You can quickly pick up on these features and execute web scraping to achieve the ideal data extraction outputs if you are a beginner.
* While working on the library, Beautiful Soup offers a strong community to address all web scraping challenges for both new and experienced developers.
* The primary benefit of using Beautiful Soup for developers is that it offers excellent and thorough documentation.

# Cons of **BeautifulSoup**:
+ The use of proxies is not simple with BeautifulSoup. As a result, using BeautifulSoup to download vast volumes of data from the same site without having your IP blacklisted or banned is difficult.
+ BeautifulSoup can't function independently as a parser. It requires you to install dependencies before using it.
