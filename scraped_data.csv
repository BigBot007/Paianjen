['Crypto Rallies As US Debt Ceiling Talks Continue'],"['Beacon Chain Withdrawal Queue Briefly Clears, Ether Jumps 3% By: Samuel Haig Crypto markets have started the week in the green, with Ether up nearly 3% at $1,860. Render (RNDR) is up 13% today and 60% in the past two weeks amid speculation that Apple’s rumored VR headset will leverage its decentralized graphics processing network. Kava, a Layer 1 blockchain that uses a co-chain architecture to offer compatibility with the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, rallied 8%. Only five of the top 100 digital assets have posted losses of greater than 1% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. ETH last changed hands for $1,860 after tagging $1,875 earlier on Tuesday, according to The Defiant Terminal. Notably, crypto is showing signs of resilience despite major stock markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq losing over 1% today. The US dollar remains firm as debt ceiling negotiations continue. Ethereum is riding momentum from its Shapella upgrade six weeks ago, which activated staked Ether withdrawals for the first time. Following an initial spate of withdrawal requests, the queue for withdrawals briefly hit 0, according to Wen Merge. Meanwhile, the queue for onboarding validators has swelled to more than 68,000, meaning that one would need to wait for over a month before joining the network. According to Nansen, ETH locked up for staking is up by more than 8% since Shapella went live, at close to 21M. The data indicate that newly onboarded stakers and existing validators re-staking previously accumulated rewards have already offset the ETH withdrawn from the Beacon Chain. Ether has rallied 55% this year. Ethereum’s burn rate remains high as memecoin traders continue to drive elevated rates of on-chain activity. Nearly 60% of all Ether destroyed since the Merge was burned over the past 30 days, according to Ultra Sound Money. The memecoin flavor of the week appears to be pizza, with opportunistic scammers whipping up multiple rug-pulls on Bitcoin Pizza Day. On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and early Bitcoin adopter, paid 10,000 BTC (worth over $270M today) for two pepperoni pizzas to demonstrate Bitcoin’s potential as a means of payment. In 24 hours, four of 14 pizza-related meme tokens were confirmed to be rug pulls, according to Dextools. A further five are believed to be honeypots, which are tokens which can be purchased but not sold. The scams are estimated to have raked in over $200,000. The combined market capitalization of DeFi assets is down on the month but up 37% year-to-date, currently sitting at $46.6B after starting May at $50B.  ']"

['Memecoins Continue to Dominate DEX Volumes As Crypto Market Slides'],"[""Data Shows Rug Pulls On The Rise By: Owen Fernau While early buyers of memecoins like PEPE, TURBO, and WOJAK, have enjoyed a great start to the month, the broader market has been losing ground. BTC, ETH, and BNB, the largest three non-pegged digital assets, have all dropped over 5% in the past seven days. Despite that, the memecoin craze has continued, with the tokens’ cashtags dominating social media and tickers trending on decentralized exchanges — GeckoTerminal, a data platform developed by CoinGecko, showed that four of the top five trading pairs by volume in the past day were memecoins. At over $100M, LADYS, a token inspired by the recent craze around Milady NFTs, shows the second-highest volume of all trading pairs. A PEPE/WETH pair on Uniswap is the third-highest, with just over $78M in volume. Giorgi Khazaradze, CEO of Aurox, a software company which is developing a trading terminal, suggested that while memecoins were fun for some people, less sophisticated players are generally losing money on the assets. “\u200b\u200bThe insiders that are making bank, they're drawing liquidity out of the rest of the market, the rest of the retail,” Khazaradze told The Defiant. The CEO added that it takes a coordinated effort to push a token like PEPE to such a high market capitalization. “Getting a token, especially a meme token, to trend and to go up to a billion-dollar market cap is not easy,” he said. Khazaradze added that the memecoin craze won’t make crypto look any better in the eyes of the SEC, which has been pursuing litigation against digital asset projects all year. It’s generally not a sign of a healthy market when digital assets without use cases are topping charts. With tokens like PEPE, which emphasize their lack of utility on their website, valued higher than established DeFi tokens like Maker’s MKR, it raises the question of how useful these assets really are. To be sure, the crypto market can’t entirely be written off as unhealthy — while some would say the attention and capital attracted by memecoins is a waste, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the ones facilitating the trades. So while the memecoins traders are playing hot potato with may not provide lasting value, the DEXs that traders are using continue to show their worth. Khazaradze found certain sophisticated players deploying memecoins on a regular basis and then systematically pulling liquidity from them. This is one kind of scam known as a “rug pull.” Data provided by Aurox showed that the frequency of rug pulls is increasing. There were 140 rug pulls three weeks ago, 189 two weeks ago, and 279 in the past week, with the amounts drained getting larger each week, according to the data. In the past seven days alone, malicious developers have raked in over $90M. In all, these are the dog days of crypto. Massive regulatory uncertainty persists, making it difficult for legitimate projects to confidently move forward with their roadmaps. Khazaradze, who is planning to take Aurox public this year, says he constantly needs to change the language in his filings with the SEC as regulatory and enforcement actions take place. “One of the reasons you go public is because you want to increase transparency and accountability,” he said. “These memecoins are the antithesis of that. Complete opacity and no accountability.” ""]"

['Markets Pull Back As Memecoin Mania Cools'],"['PEPE Crashes 50% From Friday Peak By: Samuel Haig Crypto markets are off to a shaky start this week. Sellers defended the $2,000 price level for Ether and confirmed resistance at $30,000 for Bitcoin, leading both assets to trade lower by around 7.5%. The total value locked in DeFi protocols dipped by 5% to $47.2B, according to DeFi Llama. The sector’s market capitalization is also down 7% at $46.4B, according to CoinGecko. The latest wave of memecoin madness appears subsiding for the moment, with PEPE shedding nearly $1B in value since Saturday. It now has a market capitalization of $864M after hitting $1.82B when Binance listed the token. Other memecoins are tumbling too, with TURBO crashing 62%, AIDOGE falling 53%, and FLOKI down 34% since the weekend began. Coingecko estimates memecoins are now worth $17.8B. Volumes on decentralized exchanges are high as traders trawl to find the next obscure token promising eye-watering gains. A 13% increase in Ethereum’s weekly on-chain activity drove a spike in the network’s burn rate, with 64,000 Ether worth $118M permanently removed from supply over the past week, according to Ultra Sound Money. The figure equates to one-third of the ETH burned since The Merge was activated eight months ago. Bitcoin is also suffering from high levels of congestion amid the recent rising popularity of BRC-20 tokens and NFTs. Average transaction fees spiked 10x since the start of May to tag a local high of $31 yesterday, according to Ycharts. Bitcoin fees have since pulled back to roughly $20. Arbitrum Nova’s daily transaction count surged more than 500% this past week, according to L2Beat. However, the network is processing a record 6 transactions per second (TPS), suggesting Nova’s adoption is only starting to take off. Nova launched last August, becoming the second chain in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Nova specializes in hosting web3 gaming and social applications. The increase in activity coincides with a nearly 60% decline in the TVL of Arbswap, the second-largest DEX on the network. StarkNet and Loopring are also enjoying a resurgence in on-chain activity, up 278% and 166%, respectively. StarkNet processed 1.5 TPS, down from a record high of 2.1 TPS last month, while Loopring executed just 0.1 TPS on average throughout the day, down from its high of 1.48 TPS last July. For comparison, Ethereum and Arbitrum each processed 13 TPS yesterday. Arbitrum is currently beating mainnet by 30-day volume, with the networks processing 35.3M and 31.1M transactions, respectively.

['Fed Hints At Pause After Another 25bps Hike'],"['Markets Trade Sideways With Ether Up 1% By: yyctrader Markets remained little changed after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for the 10th straight time, nudging the benchmark US rate up by another 0.25%. While equities turned lower after the decision, with the S&P 500 closing down 0.7%, crypto markets are trading sideways. Bitcoin is flat, and Ether is up less than a percentage point. Today’s hike could be the last in this series if economic conditions worsen, as the central bank said that any further increases would be data-dependent – a significant departure from its March statement, which “anticipate[d] that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.” Earlier in the day, a report from payroll-processing firm ADP showed that the private sector added 296,000 jobs in April, a nine-month high. This indicates that the US jobs market remains resilient in the face of tightening credit conditions. At a press conference following the decision, Fed chair Jerome Powell called the revised language a “meaningful change.” Investors are taking note. Fed funds futures already indicate a 90% probability of rates remaining unchanged in June, and predict rate cuts by the end of the year. A more accommodative stance by the US central bank would likely be a tailwind for crypto, which tends to thrive along with other risk assets like stocks when there is ample liquidity.

['Bitcoin Decouples From Stocks As Fed Decision Looms'],"['Daily Transactions Hit All-time High Driven By Ordinals By: Owen Fernau After remaining elevated for most of 2022, Bitcoin’s correlation to equities has plummeted to 12%, a level not seen since mid-2021. BTC vs World Stocks James Butterfill, head of research at the investment firm Coinshares, first pointed out the decoupling on Twitter. In an interview with The Defiant, he said he wasn’t surprised by the development. “Equities never do well, with the prospects of recession, but something like Bitcoin will do quite well because it’s like a monetary policy hedge,” he said, adding that the two are fundamentally different kinds of assets. In Butterfill’s view, the idea that Bitcoin is a leveraged bet on tech stocks is a flawed one. “It was very frustrating last year, when I just saw these tweets coming out saying Bitcoin is just another risk asset,” he said. “I thought that was such a naive and short-term view.” Bitcoin was largely grouped as “just another tech stock” in 2022 as rising interest rates seemed to bring down equities and crypto together. Now, with elevated rates starting to cause significant problems in the banking sector, BTC may be entering an environment where it can thrive while equities don’t. Butterfill emphasized that with the banking sector showing signs of stress, it’s clear that the US Federal Reserve may have made a mistake. The central bank is in a tough position – it can either lower rates, potentially pushing persistent inflation even higher, or it can raise rates, continuing to wreak havoc on the banking system. Bitcoin has tended to trend higher when banks fail, which has happened three times this year, going by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) count. The three failures represent three of the top four failures in US history based on the assets held by the institution at the time of failure. Jordi Alexander, an investor at Selini Capital who spoke to The Defiant about the “all one trade” phenomenon nearly a year ago, added that liquidity for BTC is currently low. This makes it easy for large buyers and sellers to push the price of the digital asset around. “A billion-dollar flow in either direction can be enough to overpower the equity correlation,” he said. Both Butterfill and Alexander think that if the United States enters a period of stagflation, characterized by low growth coupled with high inflation, BTC will have a chance to shine. And it’s not just Bitcoin. The digital asset’s correlation with gold rose to a two-year high in April, according to data provider Kaiko. As gold approaches its all-time high above $2,000/oz, Butterfill thinks the precious metal is also entering an environment where its relatively stable supply will attract capital. BTC correlation with Gold. Source: Kaiko Butterfill also noted that BTC tends to trade inversely with the dollar, and that if the Fed cuts interest rates tomorrow, the dollar index (DXY) will continue to slide. “Rates will probably stay elevated for some time, but they will start backing off,” he said. DXY has dropped nearly 10% in the last six months, according to TradingView. Outside of macroeconomics, Bitcoin usage is also picking up in a big way thanks to the advent of Ordinals, a way of storing data on the world’s most valuable blockchain.

['Crypto Markets Plummet As Shapella Euphoria Fades'],"['Regulatory and Macro Fears Resurface By: Tarang Khaitan Crypto markets traded sharply lower over the past week, as euphoria over Ethereum’s successful Shapella upgrade wore off while regulatory and macroeconomic risks resurfaced. Ether hit an 11-month high of $2,100 on April 15 but has since plummeted nearly 15%, breaking its five-week streak of upward price action that began on March 10. Bitcoin shed 7% of its value in the past week after briefly trading above $30,000 for the first time since June 2022. Ether’s relative underperformance could be attributed to stakers withdrawing and selling their ETH after the Shapella upgrade. Since April 12, there have been net outflows of 546,000 ETH ($1.1B). ETH Net Staking Balance. Source: TokenUnlocks “The deteriorating sentiment among investors has reversed the initial euphoria that led to and shortly followed the Shapella upgrade, which was expected to drive more institutional investors to the asset,” said Daniel Takieddine, CEO of BDSwiss. In addition, the native ETH staking yield has dipped below 5% for the first time since March 31, according to Token Unlocks. While the US Federal Reserve has been trying for over a year to cool inflation by hiking interest rates, consumer prices remain elevated while riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto have faced a rough year. After the most recent 25bps hike in March, ETH and BTC dropped by 4%. Market participants overwhelmingly predict another 25 bps rate hike at the central bank’s next meeting on May 3. Meanwhile, US regulators continue to take aim at crypto. Congress is revisiting a draft bill that would require stablecoin issuers to provide monthly attestations of their reserves, along with banning certain types of algorithmic stablecoins. The SEC sued the Bittrex crypto exchange, alleging that it had sold unregistered securities in the form of tokens like ALGO and DASH.

['Ether Surges To 11-Month High Despite $2B In Pending Withdrawals'],"['Staking Deposits Outpace Withdrawals On Friday By: Aleksandar Gilbert and Samuel Haig Ethereum’s long-awaited Shapella upgrade went over a day ago, yet there are no signs of the havoc some analysts predicted would ensue once staked Ether could be withdrawn. Ether defied expectations that a sudden flood of post-Shapella selling pressure could drive down the asset’s price, rallying 10.5% in the 24 hours following the upgrade. ETH last changed hands for $2,100, its highest level in 11 months. Ethereum’s bullish price action came in spite of the network processing a meaningful number of withdrawals, with 110,525validators removing 221,253 ETH ($445.6M) since the upgrade, according to Beaconcha.in. Staked Ether withdrawals were activated as part of Thursday’s Shapella upgrade, roughly 28 months after staking first launched. Meanwhile, deposits surged Friday and began to outpace withdrawals, according to Nansen, though the total amount of staked ETH remains below its pre-Shapella high. “It seems like we’re reaching a kind of equilibrium faster than expected,” Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman told The Defiant. “There are still very high net withdrawals, but the withdrawals are slowing in pace, and deposits are still coming in pretty hot. I expected that process to take weeks, maybe even months, and it looks like we’re heading towards supply hitting a sort of trench and maybe even picking up again sooner than anticipated.” According to Token Unlocks, 330,310 validators are waiting to make partial withdrawals, while 18,640 will entirely exit their positions, equating to 974,700 ETH ($2B) currently in the queue. Withdrawals are limited to 1,800 daily, or around 58,000 ETH, slowing the rate at which validators can exit. Kraken, the centralized exchange that agreed to wind down its custodial staking service after settling a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February, accounts for 63% of pending withdrawals. Data from Token Unlocks shows that 95% of withdrawn ETH comprised accumulated rewards as of Thursday evening New York time, meaning just 5% of stakers pulled out their initial deposits. Darren Langley, general manager of Rocket Pool, told The Defiant that many validators would withdraw their accumulated Ether rewards with the intention of staking the coins to earn additional yield after Shapella’s activation. “While there may be some short-term selling pressure in the market, it is likely that the majority of operators will choose to re-stake,” he said. Langley added that validators might also choose to sell off a portion of their rewards to cover their tax obligations. Mark Monfort, the director of web3 venture firm, NotCentralised, was skeptical of the theory that Ethereum stakers would exit en masse, arguing that many stakers deposited Ether at higher prices and were unwilling to realize a loss. “With the current price of Ether lower than when many users staked their funds, it’s also possible that these holders may not want to sell at a loss, which could limit the impact on the market,” Montfort told The Defiant. According to Dune Analytics, 70% of ETH stakers paid above the current price of Ether to accumulate their stake. However, when factoring in accrued rewards, 48% of stakers remain unprofitable. The average price staked Ether was purchased for is $2,136, according to Nansen. Thurman doesn’t think sell pressure will surge in the event the Ether rallies past $2,136. “Because a lot of retail investors were staking via LSDs [such as Lido], they sort of already had the chance to sell” by selling liquid staking derivatives like stETH or rETH, he said. “But it is possible some of these larger institutional players might keep an eye on that number.” ']"

Bitcoin and Ether are up just over 2% after U.S. inflation rose at a slower rate than expected, signaling the Federal Reserve may cool the pace of interest rate hikes. Crypto rises at the prospect that the Fed may slow its rate hikes. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, which in turn means there will be more capital available to buy risk assets. Digital assets have rebounded this year from the worst bear market since 2019 in part as speculation grows that the U.S.’s fight against inflation with hawkish monetary policy is finally paying off. The Commerce Department on Friday said the personal consumption expenditures price index, stripped of volatile food and energy prices, had increased three-tenths of a percent month-over-month, and 4.6% year-over-year. That measure tracks the “broadest set of goods and services,” according to the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve, and is often called the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. According to crypto investment firm GCR, the core PCE price index figures were better than expected. And they show inflation in the U.S. cooling since January, when they rose six-tenths of a percent month-over-month, and 4.7% year-over-year. Along with a banking crisis triggered by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes, the data have cemented investor predictions that the Fed will opt for a small increase at its next meeting on May 2, if it chooses to raise interest rates at all. A week ago, just after the emergency acquisition of Credit Suisse by its rival UBS, and only a week after the collapse of Silicon Valley, Silvergate and Signature banks, investors were betting the Fed would keep interest rates flat at its May 2 meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. But fears of a widespread banking crisis have eased somewhat, and the odds of a slim interest rate hike spiked at the beginning of the week.

The value of crypto locked in the Binance-built BNB blockchain has dropped 2.7%, while BNB, the token that powers that blockchain, has declined 4.3% since news broke on Monday that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had sued Binance, its founder and a former executive. Those declines just barely outpaced a broader drop in crypto markets. The lack of market reaction shows traders are betting the CFTC’s actions won’t disrupt Binance’s operations. The lawsuit against crypto’s largest exchange is the latest in a series of regulatory actions that have prompted speculation U.S. regulators are lawmakers are carrying out a coordinated effort against the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, outflows from Binance’s centralized exchange have been muted too. Users withdrew about $1.2B from the exchange on Monday.

And analysts are confident Binance will survive the CFTC lawsuit. “Much ado about nothing,” Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer at crypto investment firm Arca, wrote on Twitter. “Irrelevant for Binance or overall market … They didn’t lose customer money nor get accused of meaningful illicit transactions.” But some attorneys flagged allegations within the complaint that could become fodder for a criminal investigation led by the Department of Justice. Details in the lawsuit suggest Binance suspected its platform had been used by criminals and entities subject to U.S. sanctions. “The CFTC actually has a fairly narrowly tailored complaint IMO and isn’t really seeking to establish new law,” Collins Belton, managing partner at Brookwood P.C., wrote. “But, like I said, I would be…very surprised if the DOJ isn’t closely behind given these AML/sanctions allegations, so, steel yourselves.” In a 74-page complaint, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was suing Zhao, three of the myriad entities “that operate the Binance platform,” and a former Binance executive. Among other things, the CFTC is seeking to fine Binance; permanently ban the company and its employees from trading commodities in the US; and claw back money Binance made from customers based in the U.S. “The defendants’ own emails and chats reflect that Binance’s compliance efforts have been a sham and Binance deliberately chose – over and over – to place profits over following the law,” Gretchen Lowe, the CFTC’s chief counsel, said in a prepared statement.Prominent crypto attorney Gabriel Shapiro called the CFTC’s proposed penalties “aggressive and potentially destructive,” but acknowledged there was no guarantee a court would grant those penalties if Binance were found guilty.

Markets turned lower after Fed chair Jerome Powell said that central bank officials “don’t see rate cuts this year,” in a press conference following the release. Bitcoin, which hit a nine-month high in March, is down over 4% in the past hour, while Ether, the second-largest digital asset, is down 3%. Most major tokens are down, with Ripple (XRP), Cosmos (ATOM) and GMX down over 5%. The overall value of the crypto market has dropped by 3% to $1.19T in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The broader equity markets appear to have taken the Fed’s move in their stride — the S&P 500 rallied initially but is now trading flat on the day. This Fed decision was one of the most anticipated in recent memory. Two of the three largest bank failures in US history took place in March 2023. The banks’ bond portfolios witnessed a significant decline, which played a key role in their failures. These losses came about as a result of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes, which started in March 2022 and have continued at each of the eight following meetings, including the most recent one today. Despite the Fed’s efforts, however, inflation is still running hot in the United States. The latest Consumer Price Index for February placed year-over-year inflation at 6%. The Fed acknowledges this. “Inflation remains elevated,” it said in the press release announcing the decision. While prices are down, open interest on Bitcoin, which is the total value of options for an asset, is up in a big way — Deribit, the leading options platform accounting for 90% of BTC open interest, shows a major spike to over 400,000 contracts betting on the price of the world’s most valuable digital asset. That’s a record for the platform, according to its data dashboard. In a conversation with The Defiant, Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, pinned the surge in interest in options primarily on a potential banking crisis. “This time, the core value of Bitcoin is showcasing what it’s meant to do, and that’s this peak,” he said. Around 90% of Deribit’s customers are institutional traders, Strijers said, which suggests that the recent surge hasn’t been driven by retail trading. To shore up the banking system, the central bank has also introduced a new lending facility called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The program allows banks and other financial institutions to borrow against bonds like U.S. Treasuries at face value. The idea is that BTFP will allow banks to monetize their now-devalued securities without having to sell them, making the institutions more able to meet depositors’ withdrawals. The jury is out on whether the program is simply quantitative easing by another name, or whether it won’t have the inflationary impact that quantitative easing is generally accepted to have. Going into the meeting, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s FedWatch tool placed the probability of a 25 basis point hike at 86.4%. Looking forward to the Fed’s next meeting in May, investors expect a 50% chance of another 25 basis point hike. May Target Rate Probabilities ']"

['Crypto Markets Surge As Investors Predict Fed Pause'],"['Bitcoin and Ether Approach $26K, $1,800 By: Aleksandar Gilbert As higher interest rates squeeze US banks, investors are betting the Federal Reserve will slow or even pause rate hikes. Crypto markets have taken note. A rally that began over the weekend was given a boost Tuesday morning, with the release of US inflation data that hardened investor expectations of a quarter-percent interest rate hike at the Fed’s March 22 meeting. Inflation rose 0.4% in February, down from half a percent the month before. So-called core inflation, however, rose to half a percent in February from 0.4% the month before. Core inflation strips out the volatile prices of food and energy and is considered a more reliable gauge of inflationary pressure. As of noon Tuesday, the global market capitalization of digital assets has jumped more than 23% from a Friday low, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, jumped almost 30% and 25% over that same period, far outpacing the broader equities markets. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have rallied about 1.5% and 3% since Friday. Over the past week, three major banks, all of them friendly to the crypto industry – Silvergate, Silicon Valley, and Signature – closed or were made to close amid a run on deposits. But the Federal Reserve, in a joint statement with other US banking regulators, said on Sunday it would provide funding to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank so they could repay all customers in full. Silvergate had previously announced it would be able to honor customer withdrawal requests. The government’s move allowed Circle, the issuer of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, to move its assets from Silicon Valley Bank to Bank of New York Mellon on Monday. That quelled fear that USDC, one of the most important assets in the crypto ecosystem, would be cut off from the dollars that back it. Panicking traders sold their USDC over the weekend, and the token briefly lost its peg, falling as low as $0.88 before recovering. Circle said the stablecoin will be redeemable for US dollars starting Monday. Rising interest rates have had “dramatic effects on the profitability and risk profile of banks’ funding and investment strategies,” Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said in a speech last week. “First, as a result of the higher interest rates, longer-term maturity assets acquired by banks when interest rates were lower are now worth less than their face values,” Gruenberg explained. “The good news about this issue is that banks are generally in a strong financial condition, and have not been forced to realize losses by selling depreciated securities.” Later that week, when Silicon Valley and Signature banks suffered a run on their deposits, Gruenberg’s warning came true – both were forced to sell assets at a loss, prompting regulators to step in. Investors are now betting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will temper interest rate hikes to avoid further destabilizing the banking system. Raising rates – at the steepest pace in decades – is meant to cool the economy and, in turn, inflation. When strong job market data was released last week, it seemed as though the Federal Reserve would stay the course. As of last Monday, there was no chance the Federal Reserve would decide at its March 22 meeting to keep interest rates at their current levels, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which tracks the price of Fed Funds futures. Almost 70% of investors thought the Fed would raise rates by a quarter of a percent. The remaining 30% thought the Fed would raise rates by half a percent. But things have changed. As of Monday evening, the CME FedWatch tool puts the odds of no hike at 35%, and the odds of a quarter-percent hike at 65%. Investor confidence in a quarter-percent hike grew to 80% Tuesday after the release of US inflation data. ']"

['Markets Recover After U.S. Regulators Backstop Deposits At Failed Banks'],"['DeFi Heavyweights Maker, Synthetix and Lido Lead Sector Higher By: Samuel Haig The crypto markets are rebounding after Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, assured investors that its reserves held with the failed Silicon Valley Bank are safe. On Sunday, Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder of Circle, tweeted that all of its assets are secure after U.S. financial regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank. Authorities said depositors‘ funds are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s deposit insurance fund, meaning SVB depositors will have access to their funds on Monday. “The US government and financial regulators [took] crucial steps to mitigate risks extending from the fractional banking system,” Allaire wrote. “100% of deposits from SVB are secure and will be available at banking open tomorrow.” Investors responded to Allaire’s tweets by buying up USDC and DAI. Both stablecoins cratered to as low as $0.88 over the weekend as fear, uncertainty, and doubt ignited by Circle’s exposure to SVG swept through the crypto sector. With USDC making up more than 40% of the assets backing MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin, many investors dumped DAI alongside USDC. DAI and USDC have since returned to their dollar pegs, according to CoinGecko. The broader web3 sector also began rebounding on Sunday night.

Circle customers also minted 407.8M USDC on Monday as confidence in the asset recovered. On Saturday, Circle said $3.3B of the $40B in assets backing USDC were held at SVB, equating to one-third of its cash reserves. The market volatility came after bank runs crippled three of the top U.S. financial institutions serving the tech sector. On March 8, Silvergate Bank, a prominent institution serving the crypto industry, said it was entering voluntary liquidation after suffering a run on its reserves. However, many large CeFi firms said they had already unwound any material exposure to the bank. On Friday, The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (CFPI) shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) after the bank said it needed $2.25B to honor deposits. SVB also suffered a run on its reserves after news of its solvency issues broke, with the bank holding a negative cash balance of $958M on Saturday after clients withdrew $42B the previous day. On Sunday, New York financial regulators shut down Signature Bank, another institution focused on the technology and crypto sectors, citing fears that its continued operation could pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. A joint statement from the U.S. Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and FDIC said the bank’s customers will have full access to their funds. However, equity and bondholders at the banks will be wiped out. “All depositors of this institution will be made whole,” the FDIC said. “As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.” Coinbase, the top U.S. centralized exchange, said it held $240M at Signature. “As stated by the FDIC, we expect to fully recover these funds,” it said. Paxos, the U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, also tweeted it held $250M with Signature. On Monday, HSBC announced it will acquire the UK-based subsidiary of SVB for 1 British pound ($1.21). The parent company is not included in the transaction. The U.K. Treasury described the deal as protecting the deposits of SVB’s UK clients, which include many startups representing the country’s tech sector. “[HSBC’s acquisition] ensures customer deposits are protected and can bank as normal, with no taxpayer support,” said Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt. Bank of England said no other British banks are “directly materially affected” by the failure of SVB. ']"

"[""GBTC Shares Jump on Judges' SEC Skepticism""]","['Parent Company is Seeking to Overturn SEC Denial And Convert GBTC to an ETF By: Aleksandar Gilbert Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) surged Tuesday after federal judges in the United States appeared to side with parent company Grayscale in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the close of market Tuesday, shares were trading at $12.90, an increase of almost 10% from the previous day. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin fell slightly, meaning the gap between the value of GBTC and the underlying bitcoin narrowed. Last week, that discount was 46%, according to data from YCharts. Tuesday evening, it was 36%. GBTC is the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund, with almost $14B in assets under management. With the debut of GBTC several years ago, institutional investors finally had a way to gain exposure to the original cryptocurrency. Investors could exchange Bitcoin for shares in the trust, and trade those shares on the stock market. From 2015 to 2020, shares were consistently worth more than the Bitcoin they represented. On occasion, the premium topped 130%. Since March 2021, however, GBTC has traded at a discount as competing products emerged and GBTC lost its stranglehold over the market. Last year, the SEC denied Grayscale’s bid to convert the trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a move that would have allowed investors to redeem their shares for the underlying Bitcoin and, in turn, allow GBTC to trade more in tandem with its underlying assets. Genesis Reportedly Considering Bankruptcy As Funding Proves Elusive Grayscale promptly sued. On Tuesday, Don Verrilli, Grayscale lawyer and a former Solicitor General in the Obama administration, argued the SEC’s denial of the ETF conversion was “the definition of arbitrary decision-making.” The SEC had rejected Grayscale’s application arguing it doesn’t offer sufficient protection against manipulation of the spot Bitcoin market. Just a couple months earlier, however, the commission had approved a Bitcoin futures ETF that used the same risk management system. “The fundamental problem with the order is that it contradicts previous SEC orders giving the green light to Bitcoin futures [exchange traded products] that pose the same risk of fraud and manipulation,” he said. But Grayscale had yet to prove that futures and spot Bitcoin ETFs do indeed share the same risk for manipulation, SEC attorney Emily Parise argued. The three-judge panel overseeing the case seemed skeptical of the government’s argument. “What kind of data would they have to show?” Judge Naomi Rao asked Parise. “You can say that they bear the burden, but seems SEC has to explain why they are wrong in the evidence they have offered.” An outcome isn’t expected for several months, according to James Seyffart, a research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But that went better for Grayscale than I think most people predicted,” he wrote on Twitter. “Based on what i just listened to, I wouldn’t be surprised if Grayscale won over all three of the judges here.” Even if Grayscale were to succeed in court, its decision would be sent back to the SEC which could, in theory, find another reason to deny it, Verrillii acknowledged. “It would surprise me a great deal if they decided to rethink the whole thing, but I don’t see anything that forecloses them from doing so,” he said.

['Crypto Markets Plunge Amid Silvergate Concerns'],"['Layer 1 Blockchains Have Rough Week By: Aleksandar Gilbert Digital assets native to Layer 1 blockchains have taken a beating over the past week, weighed down by fears that the industry’s key banking partner might go belly-up. Silvergate Capital, a U.S. bank that services crypto companies, said in a filing this week it was “less than well capitalized,” would miss a deadline to file audited financial statements, and was evaluating whether it could remain in business — news that prompted several of the country’s largest crypto companies to sever ties. Crypto-friendly Bank Says It’s “Less Than Well Capitalized” Crypto assets and the broader equities markets have tended to move in lockstep but diverged sharply on Thursday. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both up around 2% over the past day, according to data from The Defiant Terminal, while Bitcoin and Ether have both dropped more than 5%. Other Layer 1 blockchains have fared even worse. Cardano, Solana and Polygon are down around 8% over the past week. Among major DeFi protocols, only Maker and Synthetix have seen their tokens appreciate more than 10% over the past week. The governance tokens of Uniswap, Aave and Curve are down more than 4%, 5% and 7%, respectively, in that span. Issues at Silvergate come on the heels of a regulatory crackdown this year that has sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several enforcement actions against crypto firms, and commission Chairman Gary Gensler has implied that almost every digital asset aside from Bitcoin is a security, subject to strict regulatory oversight. More troubling, however, has been a series of stern messages from U.S. banking regulators, who have stressed that holding crypto assets is “inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” “I think people under-appreciate how terrified the Silvergate developments have made the federal government,” a source at a D.C.-based crypto advocacy group told The Defiant last month. “Their need to tap the federal home loan [banks] made people afraid that counterparty risk in crypto would spill over into the traditional financial system.” The San Diego-based bank jumped into crypto years ago and serviced a number of firms and protocols. In January, it shocked watchdogs when it had to borrow $3.6M from Federal Home Loan Banks to stem a run on its deposits. Last month the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released a joint statement on crypto — the second in as many months — highlighting the industry’s liquidity risks.

On Sunday, Polygon’s Mudit Gupta flagged that GoETH were trading for $0.69 each. Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, shared data showing that users traded $1.5M worth of GoETH over 24 hours. This despite the fact that Ethereum’s devs are transitioning away from the Goerli network to a new testnet called Holli. “Testnet Ether is supposed to be free but is being marked up by speculators,” Gupta said. “Keyboard warriors will tell you that the developers are buying it but no, they are not. Maye 0.1% are buying for consumption.” Goerli is a testnet used by developers to experiment with code before launching to the public on the Ethereum mainnet. GoETH is used to pay for transactions of the testnet.GoETH was initially freely distributed to users via “faucets,” websites that issue coins to users without charge. However, developers resorted to purchasing testnet coins amid a shortage last year. Without GoETH, devs cannot experiment on the test network, posing a threat to innovation on the Ethereum blockchain. Gupta launched a faucet that distributed 6M GoETH for free. The coins he distributed would be worth $4M at current prices. Optimism Wins Over Coinbase as It Gains Ground on Arbitrum Denali Marsh, a blockchain engineer for Kava Labs, said he bought 10 GoETH for testing last week.“I tried every faucet including yours, but swapping was the only way to get the amount I needed quickly,” Marsh tweeted. “Speculation on public utilities is gross but the market drives solutions.” Gupta replied that monetizing testnet coins offers a short-term solution, but lamented that people have not invested the same resources into solving the underlying problem they’ve spent on devising methods to profit from it. The GoETH speculation comes despite Ethereum’s devs making plans to abandon the test network. “Y’all know [Goerli is] deprecated and soon to be fully unsupported testnet right?” Adams tweeted. On Feb 24, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that a new testnet, Holli, will launch later this year to replace Goerli. “Over the years, application developers’ usage of testnets grew exponentially,” Beiko said. “The distribution methods for GoETH (informal allocations + easy-to-game faucets) became less and less reliable, leading to the current issues around acquiring GoETH.”Beiko said Ethereum’s devs are considering different strategies for issuing test tokens on Holli, urging community members to reach out with suggestions. “It’s really hard to fix live testnets, but fairly easy to set up the next ones with better starting conditions,” Beiko said. “If you have strong opinions about this, now’s a good time to make them heard.” ']"

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 jumped 2.5%. That the gains are not limited to crypto assets indicates that the increases in price are not directly related to digital assets. This recurring correlation has held since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022. “With inflation comps getting easier in the coming months, we believe the macro and FED will likely be less of a factor for crypto markets for some time,” tweeted Kelvin Koh, co-founder and CIO at Spartan Capital. Regardless, there have been outperformers in the crypto space — OP, the token of Optimism, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has continued a blistering January and briefly traded above $3 for the first time on Feb. 2. The Layer 2 saw activity plummet last week after an incentive program ended, but a new proposal from the Optimism Foundation has seemingly found favour with investors. The Bedrock upgrade is touted as offering “a new level of modularity, simplicity, and Ethereum equivalence for Layer 2 solutions.” OP is up nearly 200% in 2023. Other top gainers among the top 100 digital assets are LRC, the token of Loopring, another Layer 2, FTM, the native token of the Fantom blockchain, and RNDR, the token of a GPU cloud rendering project. Curiously, ETHPoW, the network which continued running Ethereum under proof-of-work after the Merge, a massive upgrade which completed Ethereum’s move to proof-of-stake, has also jumped over 36% — it now has a market capitalization of over half a billion dollars.

Marc Zeller, integrations lead at Aave, hinted Monday that GHO could be around the corner. He also proposed that Aave add Rocket Pool’s rETH, a liquid staking derivative, as collateral against which users can borrow other assets in an upcoming version of Aave, dubbed V3. Among other things, data showing cooling U.S. inflation has sent stock markets and token values soaring since the start of the new year, with BTC and ETH both up about 25%.

['Markets Surge After Data Shows US Inflation Cooling'],"['GBTC Discount Shrinks To 39% By: Owen Fernau Crypto prices rallied Thursday in tandem with the stock market after consumer prices dropped to 6.5% from 7.1% in November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bitcoin, already having a good week, jumped 8.4% jump in the last 24 hours, according to The Defiant Terminal. ETH, BNB, and XRP, the top non-pegged digital assets after Bitcoin, also rallied — ETH is up 7.1%, BNB is up 3.2%, and XRP 1.5%. The uptick continued Friday, with Ether and other DeFi names posting modest gains. Despite the ongoing battle between crypto exchange Gemini and Digital Currency Group (DCG), GBTC has curiously surged even more than Bitcoin — the beleaguered security, which represents a share in an underlying pool of Bitcoin, jumped almost 12% on the day. GBTC is a publicly-traded investment fund issued by Grayscale, a subsidiary of DCG. Because of the structure of the investment vehicle, the security doesn’t trade one-to-one with the underlying Bitcoin it represents. Instead, GTBC floats at a premium or discount relative to the underlying BTC based on market demand for its shares — GBTC’s discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV) hit an all-time high of nearly 50% in December.

['New Year Brings Some Relief To Crypto Investors'],"['Lido And Solana Outperform As Markets Rally By: Tarang Khaitan The first week of 2023 is shaping up to be a good one for crypto markets. Leading smart contract platform Ethereum saw its native token rise 5%, while Bitcoin, which recently turned 14, posted a more modest gain of 2%. Meanwhile, liquid staking giant Lido and embattled Layer 1 Solana outperformed the broader market, surging 45% and 38%, respectively, in the past week. Solana’s outperformance is likely attributable to the recently launched BONK memecoin, which has fueled a surge in network activity. The tax year for individual investors in the US ends on Dec. 31 every year. Shrewd crypto investors potentially turned to tax-loss harvesting to reduce or defer their federal tax bills, pressuring markets in December. Tax-loss harvesting refers to investors selling their investments at a loss to lower their capital gains for the year or to incur capital losses which can be used to offset future capital gains. Cryptocurrencies are currently exempt from the wash-sale rule, which prevents investors from repurchasing their sold assets for a period of 60 days. This is because cryptocurrencies are classified as property in the US, and the wash-sale applies only to securities. In 2022, investors had to endure what some commentators deem to be the worst crypto bear market ever, with the overall market capitalization of digital assets losing over $2T. The downtrend was exacerbated by centralized entities blowing up in tandem with numerous nine-figure bridge exploits.

Liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have been a hot topic of discussion on crypto Twitter. Users believe that Ethereum’s upcoming Shanghai hard fork, which is slated for March, will allow liquid staking protocols to finally accrue fees.

['Grayscale To Consider Tender Offer If ETF Conversion Fails'],"['CEO Expects Court Decision Early Next Year By: Aleksandar Gilbert Grayscale Investments may seek to launch a tender offer for GBTC shares in the event a court rejects the company’s attempt to turn the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund into an ETF. “We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is in the best interest of investors, and we remain 100% committed to that endeavor,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein wrote in a letter to investors Monday. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holds almost $11B in bitcoin, but shares in the trust are trading far below the value of the bitcoin they represent, with a market capitalization of just $5.6B. That is mainly due to the fact that the trust’s legal structure precludes investors from redeeming their shares for the underlying bitcoin. Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected Grayscale’s application to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), on the grounds that it failed to show investors would be protected from “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.” Conversion to an ETF would have allowed investors to redeem their shares for bitcoin. Should that happen, GBTC would, in theory, trade on par with the value of bitcoin held by the fund. Grayscale promptly sued the SEC. A three-judge panel on the D.C. Court of Appeals is expected to rule on the case early next year. Should Grayscale lose “in all applicable courts” and “conclude there is no possibility of legislative or regulatory clarity that would allow for the conversion of GBTC to an ETF within a reasonable timeframe,” the company would “explore other options to return a portion of GBTC’s capital to shareholders,” Sonnenshein wrote to investors. The only option mentioned in Sonnenshein’s letter – a tender offer, subject to SEC and shareholder approval, for 20% of the trust’s shares, which would allow Grayscale to purchase shareholders’ stock at a specified price and time, likely at a premium. Last year, Marlton LLC, an investment management firm holding a significant position in GBTC, sent Grayscale an open letter calling for a tender offer. “We believe a tender offer would materially narrow — if not eliminate — the discount to NAV, immediately offering stockholders confidence in the Sponsor’s ability to manage the Fund’s discount,” Marlton wrote. If it doesn’t receive the requisite approval for a tender offer, Grayscale would not dissolve GBTC, according to Sonnenshein, “but would instead continue to operate GBTC without an ongoing redemption program until we are successful in converting it to a spot bitcoin ETF.” ']"

Bitcoin is down 1.2% in the last 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto asset, is down 1%, and Binance’s BNB is down 0.6%. Major U.S. stock indices also took a bearish turn, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrials, and S&P 500 all closing down over 2% on the day. It’s been a rollercoaster week that started off in the green, with BTC and ETH hitting four-week highs after U.S. inflation numbers came in lower than expected on Dec. 13. The Fed’s 50 basis point hike comes after four straight raises of 0.75% this year, which have depressed crypto prices as liquidity has dried up and acted as an increasingly powerful magnet to attract capital away from DeFi to assets like U.S. Treasuries. While few were caught off guard by the 50 basis point raise, the most notable bearish signal was the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, which showed that 17 of 19 Fed officials anticipated the Federal Funds Rate to stay above 5% during 2023. This indicates that the central bank isn’t shying away from keeping rates elevated at levels last seen in 2007. That’s an intimidating prospect for crypto investors who have never navigated an environment where the federal funds rate is above 3%, let alone 5%.

We actually think that this is a pretty good time to do it because most of those projects’ valuations are much more reasonable than they were a year ago.” Zhao also defended Binance as a safe place to park one’s crypto assets, insisting it did not participate in the risky and possibly illegal behavior that brought down FTX. “We don’t have loans, we don’t have debt, we don’t owe anybody money,” Zhao said. “We’re a very clean, very simple business.” Nevertheless, users have fled Binance and other centralized exchanges over the past week, according to a report from Glassnode.

['Binance to Take Over FTX After Insolvency Concerns Spark Market Rout'],"[""Binance Agrees to Bail Out Rival After FTT Token Collapses By: Aleksandar Gilbert Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, plans to execute an emergency takeover of FTX, the crypto derivatives platform that has been hit with a crisis of confidence as its FTT token lost more than a quarter of its value on Monday, Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, said in a Twitter thread Tuesday.Fears had mounted that FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, did not have enough liquidity to cover its trading positions and debt obligations. Zhao said FTX had asked for its help on Tuesday. “To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch,” Zhao, better known as CZ, tweeted just after 11 a.m. New York time. “We will be conducting a full DD [due diligence] in the coming days.” An LOI is a Letter of Intent to acquire a company.No terms for the deal have been disclosed. FTX was valued at $32B following a fundraising round in January, according to TechCrunch. Zhao had actually put pressure on FTX, which did $13B in trading volume yesterday, over the weekend by announcing Binance would start dumping its FTT position over the next few weeks. Binance had been an equity investor in FTX but sold its stake last year, pocketing $2.1B in BUSD and FTT tokens. FTT and Binance’s BNB token rallied after the announcement, jumping 26% and 12%, respectively. Ether and Bitcoin rose 7% and 3%, respectively. In his own announcement, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried said things had come “full circle.” Binance's Move to Sell FTT Position Triggers 22% Plunge as FTX Scrambles to Shore Up Liquidity “FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance forFTX.com,” he tweeted. “I know that there have been rumors in media of conflict between our two exchanges, however Binance has shown time and again that they are committed to a more decentralized global economy while working to improve industry relations with regulators. We are in the best of hands.” The deal would not impact FTX’s US business, which is a separate entity, Bankman-Fried added. Binance has the discretion to pull out of the deal at any time, according to CZ. “There is a lot to cover and will take some time. This is a highly dynamic situation, and we are assessing the situation in real-time,” he tweeted. Crypto Twitter exploded with incredulous, and angry, reactions to news of the deal.“Liquidity crunch. I thought your deposits were backed 1:1,” tweeted Dylan LeClair, a senior analyst at UTXO Management. “Or was your ‘proprietary trading desk’ directionally trading using user funds?” Ari Paul, the CIO of BlockTower Capital, questioned why an FTX bail out was necessary for liquidity when customer deposits can’t be legally lent out. “I’ll be curious to learn from forthcoming details,” he tweeted. “I’d suggest one question for the industry at this point – if same happens with Binance, who backstops? The shock deal is a dramatic turnabout for Bankman-Fried, a billionaire who has styled himself as an ambassador for the cryptocurrency industry and tried to be a bridge to the world of traditional finance, as well as Washington D.C. An MIT-educated physicist, Bankman-Fried got his start in TradFi as a trader of exchange-traded funds. He founded Alameda Research as a quantitative hedge fund in 2017. Two years later he set up FTX in Hong Kong and it quickly became a powerhouse in the crypto derivatives markets.Last spring, the 30-year-old entrepreneur co-hosted the glitzy Crypto Bahamas Conference with Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge fund impresario. Among the highlights, Bankman-Fried moderated a discussion on global affairs with former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, the former prime minister of the U.K. Yet FTX’s fortunes unraveled rapidly after CoinDesk published a story on Nov. 2 reporting that Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund, had 40% of its balance sheet tied up in FTT instead of an independent asset such as Bitcoin or the U.S. dollar. In crypto, just as in the rest of finance, confidence is the lifeblood of major players and soon as skepticism arose about the true strength of Alameda and FTX the token came into question and triggered a classic run on the bank. On Tuesday, The Defiant reported that FTX’s reserves were under siege as investors withdrew $1.2B worth of Ether and ERC-20 in a 24-hour period, and only $540M of deposits came in. As for Zhao, the deal seals a huge victory and major bragging rights in the clash of crypto titans. Born in China, he moved to Canada at an early age and studied computer science at McGill University. Prior to founding Binance in 2017, he worked for OKCoin, Blockchain.info and Bloomberg Tradebook. He’s currently ranked 75th on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index with a reported net worth of $18.3B. The trouble started last week after CoinDesk’s report raised eyebrows among investors. According to an Alameda document reviewed by CoinDesk, FTT accounted for $5.8B or 40% of Alameda’s $14.6B balance sheet as of June 30. FTT’s circulating supply was valued at $3.3B on that date, according to CoinMarketCap, meaning that more than a third of Alameda’s assets were tied to a position that may be too big to sell without crashing the market. FTX Honcho Roiled DeFi With Proposed 'Industry Norms' While FTX and Alameda had commanded a lot of respect in the marketplace there was a nagging vibe that there wasn’t a lot of transparency between their symbiosis. Many major players in TradFi and DeFi have been undone by relying too heavily on one asset to underpin balance sheets and debt obligations, as well as trades in the derivatives market. If Alameda was doing the same thing with a fabricated currency like FTT, that was worrisome. When CZ announced Binance would sell the entirety of its FTT holdings, citing the CoinDesk report, that triggered fear and selling. Meanwhile, FTT began to plummet in value, dropping from $22 per token midday Monday to about $17 Monday night, where it held steady for several hours. Observers suggested FTX was selling its reserve of SOL tokens in order to raise capital with which it could buy FTT, keeping the latter’s price from dropping further. “Kinda telling that the moment FTT is flirting with that $22 line the infinite SOL $30 bid drops away. Decisions were made,” Adam Cochran, of Synthetix, tweeted. LeClaire said FTX’s behavior resembled “an emerging market central bank attempting to defend its currency against speculators right now.” “Okay, so you can absorb $500 million of spot selling of your own token from CZ, great,” he added. “But can you absorb all of the speculators on Binance piling on short on the suspicion that you’re leveraged?” FTT eventually fell to $14.60 Monday morning. Sol fell from $32 per token to about $25 per token. Early Monday, FTX’s international hot wallet stopped processing customer withdrawals, according to The Block. Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had declined to talk comment to CoinDesk in the original article, the publication said. But they scrambled on Twitter to deny what they characterized as rumors there was weakness in Alameda’s model. Ellison insisted the document reviewed by CoinDesk only covered “a subset of our corporate entities.” Bankman-Fried accused “a competitor” of “trying to go after us with false rumors.” “FTX is fine,” he tweeted. “Assets are fine.” But that did not assuage depositors, who began a run on the exchange. And now FTX, which had bestowed its name on the Miami Heat’s arena and advertised in the mainstream publications such as The New Yorker magazine with the likes if supermodel Gisele Bundchen, will be owned by its archrival. While investors may breathe a sigh of relief that FTX has been stabilized, some market veterans warn that the risks of catastrophic failure haven’t gone away. Timo Lehes, a co-founder of Swarm, a Germany-based crypto exchange, said risk is now concentrated in Binance.“The level of consolidation means Binance is now too big to fail,” Lehes said. “Its success is now crucial to the systemic operations of the crypto industry.” — with reporting assistance from Tarang Khaitan, Owen Fernau, and yyctrader.

['FTX Hit By $1.2B in Withdrawals as Confidence Wavers in Exchange Giant'],"[""Binance's Move to Sell FTT Position Triggers 22% Plunge as FTX Scrambles to Shore Up Liquidity By: Samuel Haig FTX’s reserves are under siege as a wave of users withdraw their assets from the derivatives exchange after its dependency on its token FTT and its relationship with a sister company, Alameda Research, raised doubts about its financial strength. On Nov, 8, Nansen reported that FTX users had withdrawn $1.2B worth of Ether and ERC-20 tokens from the exchange over the last 24 hours, and deposited just $540M during the same period. FTX’s Bitcoin reserves dropped to zero at one stage, according to data from CryptoQuant. And FTT, the exchange’s native token, has plunged more than 22% in the last 24 hours. That’s an alarming development because last week CoinDesk reported that FTT accounted for 40% of Alameda Research’s balance sheet. Alameda is a proprietary trading firm that is interdependent with FTX. Yet the withdrawals are the biggest worry because they may undermine FTX’s liquidity. Bobby Ong. co-founder of crypto data aggregator, CoinGecko, told The Defiant that withdrawals on Nov. 7 drove the largest daily outflow from FTX on record. “This may materially affect FTX’s volumes and market share moving forward,” Ong said. The sudden moves show that FTX, a powerhouse in the crypto markets with $13B in daily trading volume, is suffering a crisis of confidence. As the failure of centralized crypto lender Celsius and the Terra blockchain ecosystem demonstrated earlier this year, it only takes a shift in sentiment to trigger a run on the assets of the biggest players in crypto.\xa0The close links between FTX and Alameda Research have long spurred concerns that the two firms were not being fully transparent about their off-chain holdings. Meanwhile, analysts say Alameda and FTX are selling off other assets to shore up FTT’s price. On Monday, Binance, an FTX rival, delivered a blow by announcing it was planning to dump FTT tokens on the market, according to CEO Changpeng Zhou, also known as CZ. Contagion is already spreading. Bitcoin is down 5% in the last 24 hours, and Ether has skidded almost 6%, according to The Defiant Terminal. And Solana has lost 12%. FTX is a major investor and supporter of the Layer 1 blockchain network. Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire founder of FTX and Alameda, has not addressed the crisis since Monday. “A competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors,” he tweeted. “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” Some crypto investors expressed confidence that FTX was fundamentally sound. “I personally speculate that despite operational discomfort Alameda will be able to weather this storm, either by mobilizing existing cash reserves or by SBF bringing onboard new capital to bail out if necessary,” Daniel Bar, the founder of Bitfwd Capital, told The Defiant. FTT/USD price on FTX. Source: TradingView The problems for FTX and Alameda began on Nov. 2 when CoinDesk reported that a “private financial document” detailing Alameda’s balance sheet on June 30 showed almost $6B of its $14.6B balance sheet was FTT tokens.That included $2B earmarked as collateral for some of its $7B in debt. With FTT’s circulating supply sitting at more than $3B at that time, the exchange’s FTT holdings were greater than the open market could absorb, calling into question FTX’s ability to service its debts. FTX and Alameda said the document provides an outdated picture of its finances. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison tweeted that the firm holds more than $10B worth of assets that are not reflected in the document and has paid down most of its loans since. But on Nov. 6, Binance, FTX’s top rival and a former investor in the exchange, turned up the pressure by announcing it would offload its sizable FTT stake. “CZ’s announcement that Binance will exit its FTT position caused FTT to initially fall by 11.5% to $21.96,” Ong said. Binance said it would try to minimize the market impact of its trade, and Ellison offered to direct Alameda to purchase the FTT tokens for $22 each. Binance has not explicitly stated if it will take FTX up on the offer, but its CEO, Changpeng Zhou, suggested he would be open to the idea in exchange for $580M worth of BNB. “Various crypto Twitter celebrities are calling on others to sell their FTT and the calls appear to be heeded as the token plunged through its $22 price barrier,” Mark Monfort, the co-founder of web3 venture studio, NotCentralised, told The Defiant. The standoff between the two crypto titans known simply by their initials has captured the attention of crypto. “The billionaires with abbreviations for names are fighting and as a result we are losing money,” tweeted Cobie, a prominent crypto influencer. Hasu, the strategy lead for Flashbots, chimed in:.“Toxic rivalry often degrades industry structure, leading to a worse outcome for everyone.” The drama prompted many users to withdraw their assets from FTX as a precaution against its possible insolvency, with the value of FTX’s reserves falling by $955M in one week, according to Dune Analytics. Critics Push Back Against Potential Legislation that Would 'Kill DeFi' On Nov. 8, Statelayer of SudoSwaps spotted that only transactions sized below five-figures were among the withdrawals recently processed by FTX. Julien Bouteloup of Curve Finance tweeted that his team removed more than $100M from FTX and Binance. “Fasten your seatbelt, lift-off is imminent,” he said. Michael McQuaid, growth manager at Bloq, a web3 infrastructure firm, spotted that stablecoin yields on the FTX US platform spiked as high as 84% amid the liquidity crunch. “Guessing most of those longs aren’t aware the rate is so high and will close their positions once they do.” Meanwhile, the symbiosis between FTX and Alameda Research has been thrust into the spotlight. It appears Alameda Research has been helping to keep assets flow through the exchange amid the surging demand for withdrawals. On Nov. 7, Larry Cermak, a cryptocurrency journalist, shared a spreadsheet tracking the balances of wallets suspected to be controlled by Alameda Research on social media. The data showed that the wallets’ balances fell by 47% to $230M over the past month, including $104M that was sent to FTX. The data also suggests that Alameda also moved $121M to Genesis, an institutional crypto trading and yield platform. Cermak concluded that Alameda was offloading its SOL holdings to defend FTT’s support level at $22. However, he also cautioned that on-chain data does not provide a complete picture of Alameda’s finances. “There are a lot of off-chain holdings and it’s also theoretically possible Alameda is just creating new wallets so it’s not as easy to track by idiots like me,” Cermak said. On Nov. 7, FTX withdrew $3M worth of ETH from Gearbox Protocol, despite being stung with a withdrawal fee of 20 ETH that it could have avoided by waiting for another week. “It’s absolutely absurd that no on-chain sleuths can uncover the FTX cold wallet(s), and FTX themselves will not release any info on them,” tweeted crypto investor and influencer, DCinvestor. “Alameda topping FTX off… never mind that Alameda is also simultaneously turning over every couch cushion for loose change on-chain in the process. It’s hard to imagine how they could make this look any worse than it does at the moment.”    On Nov. 8, Ben Zhou, the co-founder of the leveraged exchange, Bybit, tweeted that Alameda had breached the terms of sale when buying its BIT tokens, and had dumped a sizable share of its tokens on the markets. The BitDAO community demanded a response within 24 hours, and holds around $600,000 worth of FTT. Zhou said FTX had agreed not to sell any of its 100M tokens within three years of purchasing them. Wu Blockchain, a crypto reporter, tweeted that FTX currently holds 97M BIT tokens in its hot wallet, less than it had pledged not to sell. Ellison replied “busy at the moment but that wasn’t us, will get you proof of funds when things calm down.” Zhou thanked Caroline for the swift response. “I am sure Alameda will be able to navigate the current straits,” he said.""]"

['Rising Rate Environment Tests DeFi’s Stickiness'],"['U.S. Treasuries Now Yield More Than DeFi Money Markets By: Owen Fernau With benchmark DeFi yielding less than low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries, blockchain-based finance has entered unfamiliar territory. After the Federal Reserve’s fourth consecutive 0.75% hike on Nov. 2, the benchmark U.S. interest rate stands at 4%, the highest it’s been since January 2008. Crypto, like most risk assets, thrives when interest rates are low and capital is plentiful. The last monetary tightening cycle saw rates peak at 2.5% in early 2019. Meanwhile, 2018 saw a crypto bloodbath, with overall market capitalization crashing from $850B in January to just $108B by the end of the year. Federal Funds Rate. Source: St. Loius Fed Crypto markets have been relatively calm since the latest hike — Bitcoin and Ether are down less than 1%, and Binance’s BNB is up 5%. Chairman Powell’s statement asserts that continued increases in interest rates are appropriate, indicating that the world’s largest central bank is unlikely to turn dovish in the near term. Rising rates have pushed short-term Treasury bill yields to 3.5%, according to YCharts. That’s higher than the rates available on the top three stablecoins deposited on DeFi’s top three lending protocols, Aave, JustLend, which is on the Tron blockchain, and Compound. And all else being equal, yield-seeking capital should follow the best low-risk rates, so it’s curious why investors are still lending in DeFi at all. “There’s for sure a base of capital that’s in DeFi that is very sticky,” Teddy Woodward, co-founder of Notional, a fixed-rate yield protocol with $91.7M in TVL, told The Defiant. He said rising rates in traditional finance have somewhat attracted capital in DeFi, but that force has had a limited effect so far. “This rate divergence is pulling [capital] out and the wider that rate divergence goes, the stronger that pull is,” he said. Woodward pointed out that the circulating supply of USDC has dropped 24% since June, and suggested that higher interest rates may be responsible as the yield on USDC is 2% or lower on the top three lending protocols. Allan Niemerg, co-founder at Yield Protocol, another fixed rate protocol, agrees with Woodward. He believes that the friction in moving capital between traditional finance and DeFi accounts for why investors are still deploying their capital in crypto. “DeFi is still relatively immature and not that well connected to traditional finance,” he said. “And so, rates moving in the traditional markets don’t necessarily impact DeFi just yet in huge ways.” Even if rates in traditional finance continue to rise and attract more stablecoins out of DeFi, both entrepreneurs don’t seem concerned that it would threaten blockchain-based finance at its core. “It’s not that DeFi would die,” Woodward said. “It’s just that people would have to borrow at rates that reflect the macro environment and maybe that just means there would be less borrowing overall.” Niemerg thinks that DeFi’s true value exists regardless of the rate environment. Though he added that higher rates could lead to less venture capital investment and fewer high-risk financial strategies. To Niemerg, that’s generally just noise, however. “The signal, the hard work that I see happening every day in the ecosystem, that keeps growing,” he said. Theoretically, as stablecoins leave DeFi, borrowing rates on lending protocols would go up to reflect the lower availability of dollar-pegged assets. In a world with less friction between the two financial systems, traders would arbitrage the two rates until they were by and large the same. So far, they haven’t converged, but that doesn’t mean they won’t if rates keep going up. “People don’t shift their allocation on a dime,” Woodward said.    Moving forward, there are a few trends to watch for in DeFi. For one, the focus may move toward yield on Ether, rather than stablecoins. Notional is set to launch a leveraged product based on ETH, which is where Woodward sees yields staying high thanks to ETH’s staking rate after its move to Proof-of-Stake consensus. “I think that ETH yield and sources for ETH demand are just much less cyclical,” Woodward said. Also, fixed rates may play a role in bringing more capital into DeFi. Businesses aiming to invest in their future look for fixed-rate loans in order to reliably forecast cash flows. DeFi has only seen variable rate protocols adopted so far due to their simplicity, but if the fixed yield market matures, it could bring new participants into open finance. “I can totally see fixed rates being a really important part of the next cryptocurrency boom,” Niemerg said, adding that fixed rates could allow crypto to connect more wholly with the traditional financial system. For now, DeFi is in flux. With eye-popping yields harder to find, and those that do exist met with more skepticism, it’s going to be hard to attract institutional capital that can get near risk-free rates in the highly liquid bond markets But if Niemerg is right, the high yields which characterized crypto’s last cycle aren’t where DeFi’s true value lies. “DeFi is going to succeed because of innovation,” he said. “Because it builds something that people ultimately want. And we’re still very, very early in that process.”']"

['FTX Sees Spike In Liquidations Amid Market Surge'],"['Coinglass Data Shows $1.2B Of Liquidations in the Past 48 Hours By: Owen Fernau FTX, one of crypto’s largest exchanges processing over $10B in daily trading volume, is potentially having a record week in terms of liquidations. The exchange has liquidated $1.21B of positions in the past two days, according to data from Coinglass. Of that, $677M was related to Bitcoin positions with another $470M related to Ether. Liquidations On Exchanges. Source: Coinglass Some influencers like CL, a member of investment firm eGirl Capital, are not convinced that the liquidation data is legitimate — it’s worth noting that on both Oct. 25 and Oct. 26, the data attributed $500M more in liquidations to FTX than any other exchange. FTX did not respond to an email from The Defiant requesting confirmation that the data is correct and represents an all-time high for the exchange.    Still, the liquidations aren’t entirely coincidental — they came after crypto markets ripped higher after trading sideways for more than a month. Matt Hougan, CEO at Bitwise, a crypto asset management company with over $1B in AUM, posited that the reason for the spikes was that traders needed to buy Bitcoin and Ether in order to cover their short positions. Shorting an asset means betting on lower prices. Covering a short entails buying back the asset in order to square off the position. A sharp rise in the price of the underlying asset can lead to undercapitalized traders getting liquidated as their positions rapidly move against them. Looking forward, analyst Alex Krüger thinks yesterday’s rally may indicate a longer-term trend. “As a general rule [it’s] best to never fade a breakout following a long period of volatility compression,” he said on Twitter. Krüger pointed out in early October that strong price action tended to follow every time Bitcoin volatility (BVOL) dropped below 25. Bitcoin Volatility (Top) Vs Bitcoin Price (Bottom).

['Lido Floods Layer 2s with Staked ETH After Launching Incentives Program'],"['Lido Scrambles to Counter Coinbase and Rocket Pool as Staked ETH Market Heats Up By: Aleksandar Gilbert Lido is flooding Arbitrum and Optimism, Ethereum’s most popular scaling protocols, with its staked ETH tokens. And it’s set aside half a million dollars in incentives to do so. Less than a week after Lido announced its integration with Arbitrum and Optimism, the Layer 2 blockchains have received a combined $9M in wstETH. Holding about than $6B in user assets, Lido is the second-largest decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum, according to data compiled by The Defiant. It allows users to contribute to the security of Ethereum without the sacrifice that process otherwise entails. The move to Layer 2s is a sign the staking giant is seeking all avenues to increase its market share as competitors inch in. Lido has lost market share in recent months to centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase, that also stake ETH on users’ behalf, according to research from Nansen. And decentralized competitor Rocket Pool has launched its own incentives program in a bid to dethrone Lido. But Lido still controls roughly one-third of that market. Some researchers have speculated that most ETH in circulation will eventually be staked and will circulate as derivative tokens issued by Lido or one of its competitors. To secure Ethereum, users must lock up, or stake, their ETH in exchange for a modest annualized reward. In doing so, however, they lose the ability to put that ETH to use in more lucrative DeFi protocols. Lido addresses this by staking users’ ETH on their behalf and issuing an equal number of derivative tokens, which typically trade at or near the value of ETH and can be used across the DeFi ecosystem and are known as stETH, for “staked ETH.” Taking that one step further, wstETH, or “wrapped” stETH, is a version of the stETH token that can be used in a broader range of DeFi protocols. Its balance does not change daily as staking rewards are claimed, a feature that makes it easier to integrate the token with DeFi dapps. Integration with Layer 2 blockchains like Arbitrum and Optimism dramatically lowers the cost of trading Lido’s wstETH token, which was chosen due to its “ease of integration across various DeFi partners,” Lido said on Twitter. Trading a token isn’t just a question of software engineering, however, but of economics — is there enough liquidity in the market for that token to make buying and selling it easy and efficient for both parties? Lido is offering incentives to users who provide wstETH liquidity on Arbitrum and Optimism, and has set aside 150,000 LDO, worth about $220,000, on each protocol. Incentives are already available on protocols Kyber, Balancer and Beethoven X and are scheduled to debut on Curve, Beefy Finance and Velodrome in the coming days. With wstETH, liquidity providers were able to earn incentive-subsidized annualized rewards as high as 40% on Monday. The program seems to be working: almost $4M of wstETH has been bridged to Arbitrum, while more than $5M has been bridged to Optimism, according to data from Dune Analytics. LDO was trading at $1.55 at the time of the announcement and is down 14% since, to $1.34, according to data from The Defiant Terminal. Crypto die-hards have pushed for Lido to decentralize and thereby limit its ability to censor transactions, even if network effects were to make it the undisputed leader in staking. LSD Protocols May Make Ethereum Vulnerable to Abuses of Power After Shift to PoS To that effect, crypto firm Nethermind has asked Lido to finance its research into “decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.” That information could, one day, allow Lido to onboard trusted hardware operators in a decentralized, permission less manner.Voting on the proposal began Monday and will end October 17.

['Crypto Markets Dive After Another Rate Hike From The Fed'],"['Ether Down 4% in Last 24 Hours After Stabilizing Overnight By: Owen Fernau Global markets took a beating after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a 0.75% interest rate hike on Sept. 21. After an initial bout of volatility that saw Bitcoin and Ether make news daily highs above $19,900 and $1,400 respectively, crypto markets swiftly reversed lower. Ether posted a loss of nearly 6% while Bitcoin ended the day down 2%. In early morning trading U.K. time, ETH had stabilized and is down 4% over the last 24 hours. Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated in his opening remarks that he anticipates ongoing rate increases to be appropriate in order to bring inflation down to the Fed’s target of two percent. Jordi Alexander, the CIO of Selini Capital, noted that the Fed’s summary of economic projections shows the federal funds rate topping out at 4.6% in 2023. Alexander described this stance to The Defiant as leaning on the hawkish side. After today’s hike, the target federal funds rate stands at between 3% and 3.25%, meaning that a further increase of 1.5% would be needed to hit that level in 2023. FOMC Rate Projections Conversely, Alexander noted that the “longer run” rate projection was around 2.5%, indicating the Fed anticipates a drop in rates of over 2% from the projected 2023 peak. The Fed also indicated that it will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and other assets. This process is called quantitative tightening and reduces the circulating money supply which, in turn, makes investment capital more expensive. Leading up to today’s Fed meeting, 82% of traders anticipated a 75 basis point hike, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) FedWatch tool. The CME estimates these probabilities using futures contracts based on the federal funds rate. As of 10pm ET, nearly 65% of traders expect another 0.75% hike in November. Consumer prices in the U.S. are rising at the fastest pace in four decades, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This persistent increase in prices has put pressure on the central bank to raise rates to cool the economy. Higher interest rates make U.S. Treasury bonds more appealing, which can suck up capital from riskier asset classes like stocks and crypto. “Powell attempted to continue his hawkish rhetoric from Jackson Hole where he was unequivocal that inflation was their only current mandate,” Alexander said.

"[""'Massive Dumping' by Ethereum Miners Punishes ETH""]","['Shift to Proof of Stake Roils ETH Market But Perhaps Only for the Short Term By: Samuel Haig Ever since The Merge took place on Sept. 15 investors have looked on in dismay as Ether lost a fifth of its value over the next four days. What was going on? Many traders expected some profittaking and sell-the-news market action, but the historic upgrade was supposed to usher in a vibrant new era for Ethereum, not a spasm of bearish selling. Now, one of the causes for the selloff may be emerging — Ethereum miners are dumping ETH at record levels, according to data from OKLink. Miners offloaded 17,000 ETH in the past week. “The massive dumping from ex-miners is a significant factor to the ETH downtrend,” Harrison Dell, the director of Cadena Lega, told The Defiant. “Once the market has absorbed that impact of The Merge including the exit of ex-miners who held a substantial amount of ETH, it may start to recover and the deflationary mechanics become clearer.” Moreover, analysts believe investors have been selling risky assets ahead of a Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting of its Open Markets Committee beginning today. Investors are bracing for steep interest rate hikes in the wake of soaring inflation in August.\xa0ETH was up about 3% in the last 24 hours, according to The Defiant Terminal. Onlookers predicted that The Merge would eliminate the heavy selling previously coming from Ethereum’s miners. The upgrade replaced their services with a Proof of Stake approach that relies on validating new blocks for the chain instead of traditional Proof of Work mining. The Merge eliminated 13,000 ETH in daily rewards issued to miners, according to calculations by The Defiant. With just 1,730 new Ether entering circulation daily as staking rewards and those coins remaining locked on the Beacon Chain until withdrawals are activated with the network’s next major upgrade, analysts predicted Ether selling pressure would dry up after The Merge. But OKLink’s data shows this is not the case, with miners dumping 17,000 ETH since The merge. Miners’ ETH balances. Source: OKLink. ETH miners were accumulating rewards after the bear market took hold in crypto in May instead of liquidating regularly,” Dell said. “Many miners were awaiting positive price action from The Merge, and when that didn’t come as expected, they exited the ETH space entirely to free up capital for new ventures,” he said. Toby Chapple, the head of trading at wealth management firm, ZeroCap, told The Defiant, added that many miners still have large balances that they will be selling down over time. “Short term holders looking for ETHW tokens sold out initially and went looking for more optimal sources of return,” Chapple said. “The ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ has played out.” Chapple added that retail traders were also “excessively long” in the lead up to The Merge, making them vulnerable to liquidation. But Zerocap’s head of trading is not worried long term. “Those selling forces will abate over time,” Chapple said. “As they do, the supply shock will become more prevalent from PoS, and the demand shock from new institutional flow from the likes of ESG funds (that previously couldn’t invest because of electricity usage) start to invest.” “Long ETH was a very crowded trade before the merge, so the movement is more of a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ drop,” Jack Tan, the CEO of the Woo Network, told The Defiant. “In addition, the SEC said that ETH could be considered as security right after the merge was completed, which accelerated the regulation concerns around ETH since the Tornado cash sanction.” Ethereum Miners Struggle to Find Their Footing After The Merge Bobby Ong, the co-founder of CoinGecko, believes the pull-back has more to do with macro-forces. “I would say that the overall market decline, including for ETH, was due to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting taking place today,” Ong said. “Now that the Ethereum Merge is complete, all eyes are on the FOMC meeting, which is scheduled to take place today. “Markets are expecting further interest rate hikes to get inflation under control, resulting in the pre-emptive selling of risk assets like equities and crypto.” On Monday, Goldman Sachs strategists predicted that interest rates will be raised four more times between now and 2024, expecting rates will be held at between 4.25% and 4.5% until 2024 in a bid to tackle inflation. They tipped that the two-day meeting will produce a third consecutive interest rate hike of 75 basis points after inflation continued to rise at a rate exceeding expectations in August. “On top of the ETH market dynamics, we have the unfortunate heightened correlation of crypto to traditional markets” Chapple said. “Going into FOMC, we are seeing global risk-off behavior, which is compounding the excess long speculators problems.” ']"

['Cosmos’ ATOM Bucks Broader Bearish Trend'],"['Ecosystem Of Blockchains Unveils Interchain Security By: Owen Fernau Even as the price of Ether has sunk this week despite a successful Merge, another blockchain ecosystem is on the rise. ATOM, the native token of the Cosmos blockchain, which is the hub of the Cosmos ecosystem, is up nearly 9% to $16.50 as of evening New York time on Sep. 16. ATOM has a market cap of $4.8B, making it the 19th largest digital asset. ATOM Price. Source: Coingecko While the token is up only 2.5% in the past week as ATOM gave ground earlier in the week, that’s a strong move compared to other tokens in the smart contract space. Ether is down 15% on the week. Solana’s SOL, Binance’s BNB, and Polkadot’s DOT have all lost between 5% and 10% this week. Other Cosmos ecosystem tokens like the decentralized exchange Osmosis’ OSMO, are also showing resilience with a 5% gain on the day. ATOM holders may see their token boosted by a major upgrade to the Cosmos ecosystem called Interchain Security, which is slated to go live in January 2023. Interchain security will allow Cosmos chains to essentially secure themselves with ATOM, rather than with their own native tokens. As ATOM has a market capitalization of almost $5B, it’s much harder for a malicious actor to co-opt by gaining majority control of the network, relative to a startup chain with a limited initial set of validators. The idea, as presented by Emperor Osmo, a writer for Osmosis, is that as new chains launch and are secured by ATOM, fees will accrue to ATOM stakers. In theory, this could attract ATOM stakers, reducing the supply available on the market, and thus increasing its value given stable demand. Major projects are choosing to build on Cosmos. In June, derivatives trading platform dYdX said that it plans to deploy its own appchain in the Cosmos ecosystem for its V4 iteration. Derivatives Exchange dYdX Plans To Move Away From Ethereum And Develop Its Own Cosmos-based Blockchain For Its V4 Iteration. Developers seem to like Cosmos’ model of application-specific blockchains, which lets them optimize their design to suit their apps.

['Ether Not Quite ‘Ultrasound’ Money As Inflation Persists'],"['ETH Issuance Has Dropped By 97% By: Owen Fernau Proponents hoping to immediately proclaim Ether to be an “ultra sound” form of money can’t celebrate just yet. That’s because the ETH supply has actually increased by roughly 651 tokens since the Merge, with the data coming courtesy of ultrasound.money. ETH Supply Change Since The Merge The Merge, which completed Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work consensus to proof-of-stake on Sep. 16, reduces the protocol’s issuance of ETH by roughly 90% by eliminating block rewards to miners. After Years of Toil and Tests Ethereum Shifts to Proof of Stake and Sets Stage for Further Changes Combined with EIP-1559, an Ethereum upgrade which resulted in burning a portion of transaction fees, ETH gained the potential to become a deflationary asset. This is because the burned fees can outweigh the ETH issued to validators, given enough demand for block space. This deflationary potential, along with the implied increase in price given stable demand, led to the narrative of ETH becoming “ultrasound” money. So far though, this hasn’t been the case as low demand to transact on Ethereum has persisted. Low demand means smaller amounts of ETH burned and this has kept ETH slightly inflationary since the Merge. This doesn’t necessarily mean that ETH can’t become a deflationary asset if demand picks up, and it should be noted that issuance under proof-of-stake would have been over 22,000 ETH over the same period, using ultrasound.money’s simulation tool. ETH Issuance Simulation Under PoW Lucas Outumuro, head of research at Into the Block, a crypto analytics and research firm, predicted in July that ETH would become deflationary based on data from the first half of the year. He recently updated his thesis in to acknowledge the inflation ETH is currently experiencing. Overall, Outumuro believes that the focus on whether ETH has become deflationary or not is misplaced. “Too much emphasis is put on supply in crypto,” he told The Defiant, adding that the difference between a slightly inflationary or deflationary issuance for ETH is negligible. “The path forward for ETH is likely to be driven mostly by demand for network usage and unfortunately it remains in a steep downtrend in the depths of the bear market,” the head of research said. Ether is down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.']"

['ETH Plummets Post-Merge as DeFi Chugs Along'],"[""Ether Is Down Nearly 10% In The Past 24 Hours By: Owen Fernau Maybe the Merge was a sell-the-news event after all. ETH has fallen just under 10% in the past 24 hours, while Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has only dropped 2%. The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), the largest index focused on DeFi, is down 6%. Ether’s relatively large drop isn’t surprising considering an Aug. 8 report by Glassnode, which noted that both futures and options for ETH were in backwardation post-September. Backwardation occurs when the spot price of an asset is above its price in the futures market and indicates that the majority of investors expect prices to drop. ETH Futures Term Structure. Source: Glassnode Still, veterans of the space are rejoicing in the Merge’s wake, which appears to have broadly gone off without a hitch. Amir Bandeali, the co-founder of 0x Labs, told The Defiant that the 0x protocol encountered no issues post-Merge. 0x launched in 2017 and underpins the Matcha DEX aggregator, which has facilitated $49B in trading volume since inception, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. “As one of the earliest projects to launch on Ethereum, we’re ecstatic that the Merge was successful,” Bandeali said. “We look forward to seeing the ecosystem benefit from a stronger technical foundation and greater energy efficiency.” Borrow rates on DeFi lender Aave have returned to the 2% range after spiking to over 180% on Sep. 14 as traders positioned themselves ahead of the Merge to receive ETHPoW, the native asset of the Ethereum proof-of-work chain. ETH Borrow Rate On Aave “[It’s] surprising how fast all the rates came down,” Pedro Negron, research analyst at Into The Block, a crypto analytics and research firm, told The Defiant. The Ethereum proof-of-work chain is the result of the Merge, which left behind a blockchain running on Ethereum’s old consensus mechanism. Holders of ETH received ETHPoW equivalent to their ETH balance at the time of the Merge, leading to the rush to own as much of the digital asset as possible at the time of the upgrade. Ethereum Classic's Hash Rate Is At An All-Time High Interest rates on Euler Finance, another lender with $253M in total value locked (TVL) according to DeFi Llama, also surged and fell with the rate of utilization. Lenders like Euler are designed to increase interest rates when demand for an asset is high, partially to incentivize repayment of outstanding loans. Seraphim Czecker, head of risk at Euler Finance, told The Defiant that the protocol saw one user who had been borrowing and short-selling ETH against a wrapped staked ETH (stETH) position, withdraw $46M of stETH as interest rates on the platform skyrocketed. It’s not clear whether the depositor withdrew because the interest rate, which hit 100% on ETH, was too high or because they simply wanted to get the ETHPoW airdrop. Regardless, the depositor has since reentered the leveraged stETH position as ETH borrowing rates have dropped to 10% as of Sep. 15, according to Czecker. stETH has moved further towards parity with ETH after the Merge, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. stETH Price Trading volume in the ETH-stETH pool on Curve Finance, DeFi’s second-largest exchange with just over $5B in total value locked (TVL), hit a three-month high, according to Into The Block’s Negron. Negron thinks a possible reason people are trading back into stETH is that, like Aave and Euler borrowers, they wanted vanilla ETH to get ETHPoW. Having achieved that, traders can move back into stETH positions to continue collecting proof-of-stake yield. Additionally, staking yields are supposed to increase post-Merge, added Negron. This gives users another reason to hold stETH as opposed to ETH. Plus, the successful Merge has somewhat reduced the uncertainty related to staking, which may also have made stETH more attractive relative to ETH. Indeed, Mika Honkasalo, previously an investor at investment firm ParaFi Capital, thinks staking derivatives may usurp ETH as the primary asset in the DeFi and NFT ecosystems. In all, the Merge has caused some predictable reshuffling in DeFi, but those changes largely appear to be a return to normalcy after the rush for ETHPoW came to an end. And more importantly, nothing appears to have broken. “It was not as crazy as we expected,” Czecker said. “That’s good though.”""]"

With Ethereum no longer reliant on mining as it changed to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, the hash rate of the Ethereum Classic network is at a record 106 terahashes per second (TH/s).

Bob Summerwill, the executive director of ETCCooperative, an organization providing funding to support the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, told The Defiant the Ethereum Classic network may experience a dramatic spike in hash rate that could wipe mining profits for the short term. He estimated that Ethereum’s PoW hashing power equated to 15 times that of Ethereum Classic. After Years of Toil and Tests Ethereum Shifts to Proof of Stake and Sets Stage for Further Changes “My expectation is a flood of hashrate moving and initially that being neutral or even slightly less than profitable until a new equilibrium is found,” Summerwill said. He added that Ethereum Classic is probably the only major network capable of supporting a large segment of Ethereum’s displaced miners, asserting that “other ecosystems are too small.” “There are obviously not sufficient emissions for 15x more miners to just appear,” he added. Ethereum Classic miners are already feeling the effects of the network’s surging hash rate. One Ethereum Classic miner told The Defiant that the sudden influx in hash rate has rendered GPU mining unprofitable. GPU miners can currently expect “negative profit,” the miner said. The network’s GPU miners are attributing the plummeting profitability to former Ethereum ASIC miners, who operate specialized hardware designed specifically to mine coins using the EtHash algorithm. “Too much ASICs hash rate,” said Tommynn, another Ethereum Classic miner.']"

Investor appetite for risk continues to wane with each interest rate hike, and traders anxiously await the release of economic data that influences the size of those hikes, hoping for a signal as to when the Fed might pivot from its hawkish stance. Those hopes were dashed last week, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave a brief but highly anticipated speech at Wyoming’s annual Jackson Hole symposium. “Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time,” Powell said, hinting at another sharp interest rate hike in September. “The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.” U.S. employment figures will be released on Friday morning. Economists estimate that the U.S. added 300,000 jobs in August. In its daily market report released earlier this week, crypto market maker GSR said payroll data released on Friday “will be a closely watched data point as investors attempt to gauge the magnitude of the expected rate hike in September.”']"

Despite that, it has held its level of roughly 20% dominance, as all major digital assets have lost comparable amounts of value in that time frame. Funding rates for ETH have also hit a 14-month low, according to an Aug. 28 report from a crypto trader who goes by Maartunn. When funding rates on perpetual futures of an asset are negative, that indicates a surplus of sellers, and traders get paid to go long. As Maartunn noted, the last time funding rates were this low on ETH in July 2021, the asset rallied shortly thereafter in a short squeeze. Miner balances, the amount of ETH that miners hold, have also more than doubled from 114,255 to 261,849 in the last year, according to data from OKLink. This could indicate miners are bullish ahead of the Merge as they choose to hold their ETH block rewards rather than sell the tokens. With the first phase of the much-anticipated Ethereum upgrade just a week away, anticipation seems to be driving ETH’s price action as traders have also placed bullish bets through derivatives. Bitcoin dominance has remained below 50% for 15 months now, a first for the crypto asset. The all-time low of 36.83% for BTC.D came on Jan. 8, 2018, at a time when other digital assets, sometimes referred to as “altcoins,” had rocketed upwards. And they certainly did. From Dec. 8, 2017, to Jan. 8, 2018, ETH soared 145.8% to $1,185 from $482.

January 2017 marked the top of the last crypto bull market. Afterwards, BTC.D worked its way back up to over 70% in August 2019 as the world’s largest cryptocurrency bled, but altcoins were decimated. Now, the crypto market is bleeding again, having shed over two-thirds of its value since its November 2021 top.

As other currencies lose purchasing power faster than the dollar, their value relative to the dollar declines as well. That has pushed the U.S. Dollar to a five-week high on Friday, according to data from TradingView. US Dollar Index “The strength in the dollar really puts pressure on stocks,” Straky said, “because it doesn’t incentivize people to take risks and to put their money into equities, it incentivizes them to save their dollars.” As of Friday morning, more than $608M in leveraged crypto positions have been liquidated over the preceding 24 hours, according to data from coinglass.com.

Cooling hype over Ethereum’s coming transition to an ESG-friendly proof-of-stake technology – estimated to slash the network’s energy use by more than 99% – may have also contributed to the selloff, market observers say.

['Exchanges Welcome Ethereum PoW Die-Hards'],"[""BitMEX Readies ETHPoW Futures Contract for Anti-Merge Investors By: Claire Gu The DeFi community is pumped. Ethereum just completed its dress rehearsal before The Merge — the Goerli testnet passed on Wednesday — and ETH has soared 72% in the last 30 days. Even so, die-hards devoted to pre-Merge Ethereum are preparing to carry on trading tokens tied to the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism the network has employed since its founding seven years ago. Last week, the crypto exchanges Poloniex and MEXC Global said they would continue to support the trading of tokens tied to a PoW fork of Ethereum. BitMEX, the crypto derivatives platform co-founded by Arthur Hayes, launched a futures contract called ETHPoW on Tuesday. In a blog post, the BitMEX team mused on whether the ETHPoW fork would be sustainable and spawn a new token. It Won't be Easy to Operate in a PoS World “If the PoW chain remains alive and continues to be extended some are speculating this coin could be called ETHPoW,” said the blog. “In our view it is likely that the chain is extended past the merge point, however whether or not this chain has any economic significance is an open question.” In its most sweeping upgrade to date, Ethereum’s mainnet is poised to merge with the Beacon Chain, a Proof-of-Stake-based system, this September. Unlike PoW, PoS-based blockchains validate transactions and extend their ledgers by calling on tokenholders to stake their coins in collaboration with one another. PoW systems like Bitcoin rely on miners who compete to add blocks to the chain, a model that demands mammoth loads of computing power and exacerbates global warming. PoS is considered more secure, less energy-intensive, and better for implementing new scaling solutions. In anticipation of The Merge, Ether has performed more than three times better than Bitcoin over the last 30 days, according to data from CoinGecko. The Merge has, however, received strong opposition from those who have invested billions of dollars in mining infrastructure and don’t want to see their assets depreciate. They threaten to fork the initial Ethereum blockchain and build their own branch of PoW network to resist the change. Crypto companies are divided on the proposed PoW forks, as the market conditions are still unclear. Poloniex explained in a post that ETH 2.0’s Merge upgrade could potentially create two parallel blockchains, and the new protocol will still be operating under a PoW consensus. ETH holders will be allowed to swap the token into ETHS and ETHW at a one-to-one ratio. “If the ETH 2.0 upgrade ends up with more than one chain, ETHS will be automatically converted into the upgraded ETH at a 1:1 ratio and the ETHS market will be delisted,” the post said. “After the hard fork, the PoW chain with the most hashrate will serve as the main chain of ETHW. ” Poloniex also said the Merge could bring huge uncertainties to its operations. The tokens might lose all the value if there is not enough support from developers or community members. The ETHS token is trading around $1,664, almost the same price as ETH, while ETHP is at a much lower price around $112. Many other crypto exchanges started out their post-merge preparations but are still “evaluating the demand” and haven’t given enough details about their plans. Jay, CEO of OKX tweeted on Monday that they could “list the newly forked coins if there is sufficient demand”. Last Friday, Huobi, a crypto exchange founded in China, wrote a response to the potential ETH hard forks, saying that it would support any forked assets of Ethereum as long as they meet the requirements they listed.""]"

['Ethereum Gas Fees Fall to Lowest Level in Two Years'],"['Sharp Decline May Cast Doubt on Summer Rally By: Samuel Haig With network activity plunging, Ethereum’s transaction fees are now at their lowest level since the heady days of ‘DeFi Summer’ in mid-2020, according to data from Ycharts. Ethereum’s average fees are at their lowest level in two years, with transactions executing for less than 13 gwei a pop. The sharp decline in on-chain activity may also cast doubt on the bullish signal that’s been driving a summer rally in Ethereum and other DeFi names: The Merge. Investors may have to reckon with the likelihood that more Ether may not be destroyed than new coins are issued after the network shifts to Proof-of-Stake consensus in September. In August 2021, Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade went live, introducing the burning of base transactions fees. From then on, a portion of each Ethereum transaction fee is permanently destroyed. Coupled with the rapidly approaching Eth2 Proof of Stake chain-merge, many analysts tipped the network to become deflationary — meaning more Ether is removed from supply through burning than is created as validator rewards — after The Merge is executed next month.But with network activity plummeting amid the bear trend, Ethereum’s deflationary narrative is currently looking uncertain. Demand for block space must increase by roughly one-third from current levels in order for the burn rate to keep pace with post-merge Ether issuance. Ethereum’s transaction fees are now at their lowest level since decentralized finance began to attract a significant user base during the ‘DeFi Summer’ of mid-2020. According to Ycharts, average daily transaction fees are currently around 12.5 gwei, its lowest level since April 2020. Ethereum average transaction fees. Source: Ycharts Gas fees are also falling to low single-digits during off-peak hours, with transactions executing for as little as 4 gwei. The recent drop in on-chain activity has dramatically driven down Ethereum’s burn rate with it. According to Ultra Sound Money, a website tracking Ethereum’s burn rate, just 7,440 ETH was destroyed over the past seven days — its lowest level since EIP-1559 went live last year. By contrast, the burn-rate peaked in January amid the top of the NFT bubble, when more than 12 ETH was burned every minute, equating to 121,000 per week. Ethereum weekly burn-rate. Source: Ultra Sound Money The Merge will unify the Eth2 Proof of Stake Beacon Chain with the current Ethereum mainnet execution layer next month. The upgrade has been tipped to usher in a more than 99% improvement in the network’s energy efficiency and a 90% decrease in new Ether issuance. While many analysts are still tweeting that Ethereum will become deflationary when the upgrade goes live, the recent drop in network activity is challenging this hypothesis. The current burn-rate would offset two-thirds of Ether issuance after The Merge, according to Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. In a recent appearance on The Defiant Podcast, Drake predicted that 1,600 ETH will be issued daily once Ethereum has transitioned to Proof of Stake, equal to 11,200 Ether each week. Ethereum’s burn rate will change over time, steadily increasing as stakers lock up ETH to run a node and become a network validator. Speaking during the fifth EthCC conference in July, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder and chief scientist, said that new Ether will be issued annually at the complicated rate of 166 times the square root of the number of staked ETH. This means that if 1M ETH is staked, 166,000 new Ether will enter into circulation each year, but if 100M ETH is staked, issuance will only be increased to 1.66M Ether. According to Staking Rewards, nearly 13,15M ETH or 10.8% of circulating Ether is currently locked up for staking, According to Buterin’s equation, 1,649 new ETH would be issued daily under Proof of Stake, equal to 11,543 Ether weekly. Despite The Merge not yet taking effect, Ethereum has already produced 26 days of deflationary issuance since transaction fee burning was introduced. Ethereum has posted two full weeks of deflationary issuance so far, according to data from Watch The Burn. The first week occurred at the end of October towards the peak of the broader digital asset markets, with surging NFT activity driving the second week of negative issuance in January. The largest daily burn on record occurred on May 1 as fees soared amid the extreme gas wars surrounding Yuga Labs’ Otherdeeds NFT land sale.

The ETH/BTC ratio has climbed to 0.074, its highest level since May. According to the Aug. 5 release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. added 528,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.5%. Markets initially reacted negatively to the numbers, with Ethereum dropping 2.3% from $1,718 to $1,668 and Bitcoin diving 3.9% from $23,409 to $22,489. While an increase in employment numbers sounds great, this could actually be a headwind for the crypto market. Many believe that due to the strong jobs market, the Fed will continue to hike interest rates to adjust for higher wages and more spending, in its quest to tackle inflation. Rising rates are generally considered negative for investors placing their money in riskier assets like crypto. The Federal Funds rate is currently at 2.33%, but a hike in rates elevates short-term borrowing costs for financial institutions, which in turn, pass on those costs to people and businesses through higher interest rates on mortgages and loans. “When rates go up the opportunity cost of holding commodities goes up too, which will hurt gold, bitcoin and ether,” Scott Lewis, the co-founder of DeFiPulse, told The Defiant.\xa0That being said, Lewis mentioned that “crypto has so much volatility from other sources, you may not really feel it.” Because of the natural volatility of crypto, Josh Rosenthal, Partner at 6ixth Event Capital, was similarly uncertain about the report’s direct impact on web3. “We might be at bad news is good news or vice versa,” Rosenthal told The Defiant. Because of the high national debt, Rosenthal believes that the Fed “can only inflate to a point” and that we won’t see a repeat of the 1970-80s with double-digital rates. He explained that the best case is that the Fed “prints like mad while keeping sustained-ish [sic] inflation.” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly recently said in an interview with Reuters that the Fed would “look at the data coming in,” as a basis for future rate decisions. She went on to say that if the labor market kept growing, another 0.75% increase may be appropriate.']"

['Plumbing Google Search Data for Clues on Crypto Market’s Direction'],"[""Google Searches for 'Crypto' and 'NFTs' Have Plunged By: Claire Gu Calling the bottom of the market is one of the toughest tasks for investors. How do you know when the worst is over and maybe, just maybe, it’s time to get back in and do some buying? That question is a big one at the moment as The Merge spurs a summer rally in Ethereum and dreams of a new bull run. As investors scramble for signs this shift may be actually happening, many are turning to an unusual metric — Google Trends data. Analyzing Google searches has become one of the best ways to get a handle on investor sentiment and retail interest. The Defiant has found that in 2022, web searches for “crypto” have tumbled 73%, and those for “NFTs” have fallen 86%. Meanwhile, 57% fewer people are searching for “Ethereum”. The results are not surprising, of course. With the $60B collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May and the subsequent fallout leaving Celsius and Three Arrows Capital bankrupt, investors are steering clear of crypto. What is interesting is that the last time sentiment was this sour — December 2020 — the greatest bull run in crypto’s history was right around the corner. The market capitalization of the crypto market multiplied 17 times between March 2020 and January 2021, when total value of the sector reached $2.2 trillion. Source: Google Trends So is Google search data a contrarian signal? When sentiment gets this bad does that mean things are about to turn? If only it was that simple. What we now know is economic forces that were supposed to leave crypto alone are shaping the market’s fortunes as surely as equities or bonds. In March 2020, Western governments flooded their economies with an unprecedented level of capital to address the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns. All this money sloshing around set the stage for a bull market in stocks and digital assets as investors bet big on risk. Likewise, economic developments this year — the hangover — are taking their toll on stocks and crypto as investors curtail risk. Soaring inflation in the U.S. and Europe has been sparked by the emergency funding of the pandemic, and that’s spurring central banks to raise interest rates. Raising the cost of capital always dampens economic growth and the attractiveness of stocks, at least in the short term.What’s truly significant is that the moves of the Fed and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are also squeezing crypto, which was supposed to be immune to the machinations of authorities. Which brings us back to Google Trends data. The loss of interest in the crypto sector is symptomatic of a bear market. Google Trends data and crypto prices in the past 12 months. Source: Google Trends and Defiant Terminal Meanwhile, uncertainty around crypto’s next price movement has fueled searches on the “death” of crypto. The volume for the term “bitcoin/crypto is dead” peaked in May and June as many crypto big players imploded and the media published reports on the unsavory practices in many crypto platforms. “Crypto is dead” goes viral on Google. Source: Google Trends Of course, crypto is not dead. That’s just an emotional response to a period of white-knuckle moves in the market. And now, there’s a summer rally under way, especially in decentralized finance. Ethereum has jumped about 38% in the last 30 days, according to The Defiant Terminal. Other DeFi stalwarts — Polkadot, Polygon, Avalanche — have also posted double-digit increases. The Merge, Ethereum’s coming upgrade to a Proof-of-Stake blockchain system, is driving the buying of ETH and recalibrating the DeFi narrative. And if there’s one thing investors love, it’s a good story. Measuring Google Search data on “The Merge” may undoubtedly be a valuable indicator of sentiment in the weeks to come.""]"

['Ethereum Classic Shakes Off the Dust and Rockets 174%'],"[""Vestige of Old Ethereum Finds New Life as The Merge Approaches By: Samuel Haig It’s one of the mysteries of the summer rally. Ethereum Classic, that often-overlooked fork from the early days of the Ethereum, has skyrocketed 174% since July 13. Actually, its performance isn’t so mysterious. The Ethereum Classic community is betting that The Merge will be a boon for their sleepy token. Jamyye, an Ethereum Classic mining pool operator, told The Defiant that The Merge will bring “a ton of hash power over to ETC.” Translation: Miners are backing Ethereum Classic in anticipation of Ethereum’s forthcoming chain-merge — which will boot Proof of Work (PoW) miners off the network in favor of Proof of Stake (PoS) validators. Colin Wu, a Chinese cryptocurrency journalist, recently estimated The Merge will displace $5B worth of GPU and ASIC-based mining hardware. The Ethereum Classic community believes a significant portion of this hashing power will be redirected to ETC. Traders are already betting that Ethereum Classic will win big amid The Merge. Its native ETC token has doubled relative to ETH in past two and a half weeks.  ETC/ETH on Binance. Source: TradingView “This will drastically change the network difficulty, making it harder for miners to earn coins,” Jamyye said. “ETC will be the largest PoW smart contract blockchain — with no centralized foundation controlling it,” Jamyye continued. The Merge will unify Ethereum’s PoS consensus layer — the ‘Eth2’ Beacon Chain — with the existing execution layer — the PoW mainnet. The upgrade will improve Ethereum’s energy efficiency by more than 99% and is tipped to reduce new Ether issuance by 90%. The shift, expected to take place in September, lays the groundwork for Ethereum to become much faster when it comes to processing transactions, and could mean more ETH is destroyed through burned transaction fees than is newly issued to validators. Yet die-hard devotees of the PoW approach see an angle, too. Setvin, an Ethereum Classic community member, analyzed the hashing effect. “Right now, there is 900 [terahashes per second (th/s)] on ETH and 30 th/s on ETC,” Setvin told The Defiant. “Even if only 10% switch over that will be a huge uptick… for those who value the security that the network effect brings, that’s big.” Large Ethereum miners are already looking to support Ethereum Classic. On July 28, Innosilicon, a manufacturer of mining hardware, tweeted that it is currently working on firmware allowing its Ethereum ASICs to be used to mine Ethereum Classic. On June 26, AntPool, the mining pool associated with major mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, revealed that the firm invested $10M to support the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. Lv Lei, AntPool’s CEO, Lv Lei, said funds have been earmarked to attract developers to the ecosystem, incubate leading protocol building on Ethereum Classic, and support Layer 2 scaling solutions. Speaking at a mining summit, he added that the firm intends to make further investments backing Ethereum Classic in the future. Sophisticated Investors Pile into Options Ahead of Ethereum's Shift to PoS Bob Summerwill, the executive director of ETCCooperative, an organization providing grants and funding to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, met with AntPool at the recent mining summit. He told The Defiant there are ongoing discussions between the Ethereum Classic community and other companies representing the mining sector.“There is a huge quantity of GPU mining hardware which will be looking for a new home,” Summerwill said. “And ETC is by far the largest such project by block rewards after ETH. Other chains have no hope of absorbing even a fraction of the hash rate before becoming unprofitable.” Summerwill also predicts that Ethereum Classic will experience “sizable growth” amid The Merge. “Many people trust in POW and are uncertain or downright untrusting of PoS. ETC is a natural home for such people… with The Merge, there will finally be a practical differentiation between ETC and ETH which has been lacking while ETH remained PoW,” he said. “With ETC Coop’s existing funding, plus Antpool, plus others, we will have a good sized war chest to fund ecosystem growth of stablecoins, DEXes, DOAs, NFTs, and Defi and dApps of all types,” Summerwill added. Ethereum Classic even appears to have found an unlikely post-merge ally in Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder and chief scientist. Speaking at the fifth EthCC conference on July 21, Buterin suggested that PoW devotees should consider joining the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. He described the chain as “the original Ethereum which did not betray the vision by forking The DAO” and “a very welcoming community.” “I think they’ll definitely welcome PoW fans,” Buterin continued. “It’s not even a joke — if you like PoW, you should go use Ethereum Classic. It’s a totally fine chain.”""]"

On July 28, the total amount of put and call contracts on ETH surpassed BTC for the first time, according to data provider Glassnode. Source: Glassnode Open interest is the notional value of the puts and calls of a given asset that haven’t been settled yet. Puts are usually a bet a security will decline in value, and calls a wager the value will increase.\xa0The put/call ratio on ETH options is 0.26, according to the trader who goes by Chang, a partner of the Derebit options platform. This indicates a heavy weighting toward people looking to go long on Ethereum’s token. With developers expecting Ethereum to merge its Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake blockchains on Sept. 19, ETH has soared more than 47% in the last 30 days, according to CoinGecko. The Merge marks the most significant overhaul of Ethereum. The switch is expected to dramatically reduce gas fees and improve efficiency for the leading system of smart contracts and dApps. Most of the options expire after The Merge, according to Chang on Twitter. This further indicates that derivative traders are betting on the upgrade as a major upward driver on ETH’s price. The ETH/BTC ratio has also shot up from a year-to-date low of 0.052 on June 16, to .069 on Aug. 1, according to a Trading View chart.

['Summer Rally Spurs Hopes Bear Market is Shifting into Bull Run — But is It?'],"[""Tempting to Believe a Shift is Under Way But Economy Clouds the Picture By: Claire Gu When does a bear morph into a bull? That’s the question crypto investors are asking as the fire and brimstone of the last three months has suddenly given way to a rally.This month, the market seems to be gone on a run. Ether has skyrocketed an astonishing 50% in the last 30 days, Bitcoin has popped 18%, and other DeFi blue chips — Polkadot, Uniswap, Aave — are posting gaudy performances of their own. In a throwback to last summer, Solana has soared 80% in the last month. Ether has outpaced Bitcoin since mid July. Source: Defiant Terminal Now the question on everyone’s mind is: Is the worst over? Is it time to get back in? While it’s hard to navigate the crosscurrents of a shifting market, studying previous market downtrends is always helpful to give us some reference as to what the end of the bear would look like. Yet that’s easier said than done. “We cannot really draw parallels between these two bear markets,” said Kevin Murcko, founder and CEO at Coinmetro, a crypto exchange based in Estonia. “On a macro level, the 2018 bear market didn’t have to deal with record high inflation rates as well as the macro-economical and geopolitical storms we are currently facing globally. ” Murcko said the distribution of investors is vastly different now. Back in 2018, the market was dominated by retail investors. “Today, we have a large proportion of institutional investors doing the same thing they do in every market -— leading the narrative, selling into buyers and buying into sellers. ” The 2018 bear was very similar to the dot-com bubble because many initial coin offerings proved to be as vacuous as those infamous internet 1.0 ventures 22 years ago. So after investors lost confidence in the market, everything crashed. Ethereum's Shadow Fork Trials are Driving Anticipation for The Merge Even so, the seeds of DeFi were planted during the crypto winter from 2018 to 2020. “Most of the projects born in the ICO boom were built on Ethereum, which was still very immature around that time,” Timo Lehes, co-founder of Swarm, a Berlin-based regulated crypto exchange, told The Defiant. “There wasn’t much real engagement or activity on the network” If DeFi is built on a solid foundation, does that mean the summer rally augurs a return to bullish ways? Murcko isn’t sold on the idea. Given the clouded economic picture — the U.S. just recorded its second straight quarter of contraction in industrial output — the rebound may not be a sustained rally but just a correction, he said. “Retail investors are behind this move, while institutional investors are selling into them.,” he said. “However, the former has much smaller pocketbooks. When they are done buying, we will see at least a retest of lows or, more realistically, set new range lows.” So how do we tell if the worst part is over? There needs to be a change in fundamentals. “Until we see lower inflation numbers, equity and bond markets coming back to life, as well as market sentiment becoming much more positive, we cannot be sure that the worst is over,” says Murcko. “My advice would be to find assets you believe are connected to companies, projects, or foundations that are actually doing what they have promised to do, have strong fundamentals and a proven track record. ”""]"

['Ethereum Pops 10% as Fed Signals Rate Hikes Are Working'],"['Global markets are rallying after the US central bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points in a widely expected move. By: Aleksandar Gilbert Crypto markets rallied on Wednesday and Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% for the second time in two months in a widely telegraphed move. Ether is up 10% to $1,616 in the past 24 hours in early morning trading U.K. time, according to data from The Defiant’s newly released charting tool. Bitcoin rose 7.4% to $22,897. Solana and Polkadot also rallied 16.5% and 11% respectively. Source: The Defiant Terminal Repeated interest rate hikes this year by the Fed and other central banks may be working, the Fed said in announcing its decision. “Recent indicators of spending and production have softened,” it said in a news release. Investors love the sound of that and the S&P 500 Index, the leading bellwether for stocks in the U.S., jumped 2.6% on Wednesday. Cryptocurrencies have been correlated with equities fas a risk asset or several quarters now, and investors have been buying and selling both types of assets in tandem. But other metrics — namely the unemployment rate and, of course, the consumer price index — suggest an economy that is still running hot, and the Fed indicated more interest rate hikes would be forthcoming. Such hikes increase the cost of borrowing in the broader economy. The cascading effect — less spending by businesses and consumers, less revenue for businesses, and, eventually, layoffs — is meant to cool demand for goods and services, easing upward pressure on prices. Markets typically drop as interest rates rise. But observers had expected Wednesday’s 75 basis point hike, and were relieved the Fed did not take more aggressive action than forecast. “The outlook hasn’t looked this good in a while,” Hal Press, the founder of crypto hedge fund North Rock Digital, tweeted. “We just got first signs of a real fed pivot, earnings are better than feared and there’s no more meetings for two months.” Wednesday’s rally wasn’t limited to Layer 1 tokens.

['Ether and Bitcoin Slide Ahead of Expected Interest Rate Hike Wednesday'],"['SEC Reportedly Probes Coinbase on Securities Registrations By: yyctrader All eyes are on the Federal Reserve this week as the U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase benchmark interest rates by another 0.75% on Wednesday, following a similar move in June, the largest hike since 1994. Source: CME FedWatch A solid run up over the past month saw Bitcoin and Ether rally 26% and 65% respectively from their June lows, pushing crypto’s market capitalization back above $1T. As the price of everything from oil to corn soared this year, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates in a bid to cool the economy and rein in demand. At a consumer level, rising interest rates encourage people to spend less and save more, as financing big-ticket items like houses becomes more expensive. For businesses, the increased cost of capital dissuades investment in growth, and combined with weaker consumer spending, can lead to reduced revenues. Heavily indebted companies will see their interest expenses rise, leaving fewer resources available for spending. Higher rates also increase the cost of servicing the $30T American national debt, with each percentage-point rise adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the annual interest bill. Inflation in the US hit a record 9.1% in June, leading some to speculate that the Fed would go for a supersized 100bps hike in July. However, markets shrugged off the numbers after the central bank signaled its intent to stick with 75 basis points. Crypto markets traded lower on Monday as investors digested the news that Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange, is reportedly being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it facilitated the trading of unregistered securities. Shares in Coinbase, which has a market value of almost $15B, fell 5.3% on Monday. The story was first reported by Bloomberg.

['Ether On Exchanges Plummets To 4-Year Low Ahead Of The Merge'],"['Ether held on exchanges has dropped 40% in the past year to 19M ETH.

Centralized exchanges held 19M ETH early Thursday, down from an all-time high of almost 32M ETH in the summer of 2020, according to data from Glassnode. The last time CeFi exchanges held less than 20M ETH was in July 2018. Source: Glassnode Among exchanges tracked by Glassnode, Huobi accounted for the most significant drop over the past four years. In the summer of 2018, it held 5M ETH. This week, it was down to less than 40,000 ETH. Coinbase also saw a steep decline, from 8M in custody four years ago to 5M this week. Meanwhile, outflows from exchanges tracked by Glassnode hit a 13-month high. The surge in outflows suggests that traders are holding on to their Ether in the hopes of a continued rally. Sentiment has undoubtedly been buoyed by Ethereum developers setting a tentative September date for The Merge, the network’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake. In other market news, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday for the first time in 11 years. The decision took investors by surprise as the ECB had signaled a 25 basis point hike at its last meeting. Nevertheless, crypto markets were relatively calm on Thursday, with little sign of the steep sell-offs that have followed rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. With the exception of Bitcoin — still reeling from Tesla’s Wednesday disclosure that it had sold nearly $1B of the digital currency — the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were all trading higher on Thursday, according to data from The Defiant’s newly released charting tool. “Maybe because the distance to current inflation rate (ca. 10%) is still too high [such] that 0.5% does not matter for the market anymore?” Philipp Sandner, the founder of the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center at Germany’s Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, mused on Twitter. At a news conference in Frankfurt on Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the bank’s decision to raise rates by 50 basis points, rather than 25, was “based on our updated assessment of inflation risks.” “The frontloading today of the exit from negative interest rates allows us to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to our interest rate decisions,” Lagarde said. “Our future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation target over the medium term.”']"

Crypto market cap is rallying. SOURCE: TradingView Cryptocurrencies began trending upward last week. The top seven cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are all up at least 13% since July 12, according to data from The Defiant’s newly released charting feature. The rally can be attributed to several things, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto fund Arca: broader macroeconomic trends, positive developments within crypto and investors betting on the success of The Merge. “First and foremost, macro level, you’ve seen a little bit of an easing on the pressures,” Dorman told The Defiant. “You’ve seen the dollar stop going higher, you’ve seen front end yields start to come in a little bit. The [U.S. Federal Reserve] and other central banks have started to pivot a little bit towards, if not less aggressive inflation fighting [then] certainly at least more acknowledgement they might have caused too much damage to the economy and therefore would have to lower [interest] rates at some point.” The crypto-to-equities correlation is indeed alive and well: the S&P 500 is up 3% since June 12, when Ethereum began to surge. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 5.6% in that same period. But there are several things that pushed crypto’s gains beyond those of the U.S. stock market, according to Dorman. “I think we all can agree that DeFi did its job whereas CeFi didn’t,” he said, echoing other market observers and crypto enthusiasts who saw DeFi vindicated in the fallout from the bankruptcies of firms like Celsius and Voyager. “As a result, it wasn’t surprising that the rally was led by DeFi tokens.” DeFi index DPI is up 31% in the past month. Other tokens were buoyed by positive developments, Dorman added. But the “big one” came late last week, when Ethereum developers gave a clear, if tentative, timeline for the long-awaited update known as The Merge. If all goes as planned, The Merge will occur on September 19 and slash the network’s energy use and, in turn, carbon emissions by an estimated 99%. Ethereum's Shift to Proof-of-Stake is Spurring Rally Indeed, while the world’s largest cryptocurrencies have appreciated in value over the past week, Ether has raced ahead and rallied 40% since June 12, according to data from The Defiant’s newly released charting feature. Solana came in second, having risen 25% in that same span. “When you put all those things together, you start to realize that most of the sell-off from Bitcoin $28,000 and Ethereum $1,800 was not because people were trying to sell,” he said. Rather, it was caused by the forced selling of the two assets by distressed firms like crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. And the worst may be behind us. “I think, you know, Three Arrows was the biggest culprit from a leverage standpoint, and basically all their collateral has been liquidated,” he said.""]"

['DeFi Stalwarts Buck Bear Market'],"['UNI, MKR and AAVE have outperformed Bitcoin and Ether in the past three months. By: Aleksandar Gilbert Governance tokens for blue chip DeFi protocols Aave, MakerDAO and Uniswap have outperformed Bitcoin and Ether in the three months since the crypto market began its collapse. As crypto companies that once managed billions in user assets declare bankruptcy, established DeFi protocols have, thus far, stayed afloat amid choppy waters. Crypto markets have, by and large, followed stocks in a broad decline this year. But crypto was also rocked by the implosion of Terra and its UST stablecoin in May, which set off a chain reaction that has culminated in the liquidation of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the bankruptcies of Voyager Digital, a publicly-traded cryptocurrency platform, and crypto lender Celsius. DeFi proponents found a silver lining in the news, however, noting that decentralized protocols holding billions in users’ crypto and offering the same services as their failed centralized (CeFi) counterparts seemed to have weathered the storm. Despite a weekend price surge, Ether has lost 49% of its value since late April, according to data from TradingView. But governance tokens for Aave, MakerDAO and Uniswap – three of the top five DeFi protocols, as measured by total value locked – have outperformed it. Source: TradingView Aave has lost 44% of its value since late April while MKR has lost 43%. UNI is only down 19%. Meanwhile, the protocols themselves remain solvent; a low bar by which to measure success, perhaps, but one that advocates have trumpeted as once high-flying CeFi businesses fail. The website makerburn.com, which provides an estimate of the Maker protocol’s annual profits “if expenses and parameters remain stable” shows a steep decline in Maker’s revenue. In late April, the protocol could be expected to rake in $60M over a 12-month period. That figure has since plunged to just over $2M. But it remains in the black. The Aave ecosystem reserves held $355M at the end of 2021, according to data compiled by Llama, a support community for DAOs. The reserves currently hold a little more than $123M. Uniswap, meanwhile, made headlines last month when it surpassed Ethereum in daily fees. It has not relinquished its spot atop that chart since. Proponents have celebrated one particular recent development as vindication of the DeFi thesis. Crypto lender Celsius Network recently declared bankruptcy. Even as it was preparing to do so, it was rushing to pay back its outstanding loans on Aave, MakerDAO and Compound. Some have posited that DeFi protocols have been spared the carnage that befell their CeFi counterparts because on-chain data, available for all to see, deters would-be bad actors, or at least makes it possible to respond to adverse developments in real-time. DeFi lending protocols eliminate counterparty risk as they take trust out of the equation with overcollateralized loans. Liquidations are carried out on-chain with no exceptions. Tarun Chitra, the founder of crypto firm Gauntlet, took a slightly different tack in a series of tweets Monday. “Arguably, the main difference between CeFi and DeFi couterparty risk is not that it’s *eventually* transparent (when a counterparty blows up all of your private docs are public in court) but that your agreements are actually enforceable without needing a government’s helping hand,” he wrote. Or, as someone who commented in response put it: “CeFi – fuzzy enforcement,” while “DeFi – algorithmic enforcement.”']"

If Celsius is bankrupt, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize something strange is going on. CEL vs S&P 500 Many on Twitter speculated that there was reckless trading or “whale games” going on, but our source at crypto analytics firm Messari said this is not the case. “The only way price goes down is that people sell. But in order for that to happen, they need to hold the tokens to sell in the first place,” Messari analyst Dustin Teander explained. “Currently, over 90% of the supply is held in various Celsius wallets. Celsius naturally isn’t a seller of their own token and the remaining holders aren’t large enough to drive the price down significantly.” If Celsius tried selling its supply of tokens, Teander believes Celsius “would likely find there are no buyers and the price would drop to reflect its true value”. In the last 72 hours since Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, CEL has dropped from $0.91 to $0.45 and then shot back up to $0.78.

Despite the bullish momentum for DeFi tokens, the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has produced a weaker recovery so far, with combined TVL up by 15% over the same period at $83.1B, according to DeFi Llama. Combined DeFi TVL. Source: DeFi Llama Ethereum-based DeFi protocols are outperforming the sector’s average, increasing TVL by more than 18% from the local low on July 13. Ethereum now represents $52.6B in TVL, equal to 58% of the combined TVL. By contrast, top Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer 1s Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Solana have added between 9.5% and 11.5% to their TVLs over the same period. Leading Ethereum Layer 2s are also underperforming compared to Ethereum, with L2beat estimating the sector is worth $4B after gaining 11% in five days. Tron is the only major network to post consistent growth throughout July, growing from $4B to $5.86B since the month began. The growth can predominantly be attributed to the Tron-based money market protocol, JustLend, which has grown 120% to represent a TVL of $3.3B since the end of June and represents 57% of the network’s locked value.

['Multicoin Raises New $430M Web3 Fund'],"['The fund will make investments in web3 infrastructure, DAOs and DAO tooling, consumer products, new IP-based business models, and creator monetization. By: Jason Levin Despite the bear market, venture capitalists are still raising money and looking to deploy capital. On July 12, crypto venture capital fund Multicoin Capital said it has raised $430M to invest anywhere between $500K-$25M in early-stage opportunities and up to $100M in mature projects. The fund will make investments in web3 infrastructure, DAOs and DAO tooling, consumer products, new IP-based business models, and creator monetization. Multicoin is looking for protocols that offer “proof of physical work” – ones that incentivize communities to “do verifiable work that builds real-world infrastructure.” Multicoin Capital began investing in crypto five years ago and their portfolio includes early investments in Ethereum, Solana, blockchain explorer Dune Analytics, crypto-IoT network Helium, crypto exchange FTX, and DAO accelerator Seed Club. Multicoin will be especially focusing on “DataDAOs” – DAOs that incentivize users to contribute data and push data governance into the hands of their communities. Tushar Jain, co-founder and Managing Partner at Multicoin, told The Defiant he expects many DataDAOs to pop up that could be “segmented by data type (mapping/location, social media, financial transactions, etc.)” or “segmented by data consumption ( having different DAOs selling to different customers, consumers joining multiple DAOs)”. Multicoin has already invested in Delphia, a DataDAO that uses investors’ data to improve its trading strategy. “Multicoin is probably the single most contrarian venture fund operating in the crypto arena right now. They are not afraid to bet big and be first,” Delphia CEO Andrew Peek told The Defiant. Multicoin is also focused on DAO tooling, especially projects which enable new ways of capital formation. “This could be things like group buying of NFTs, NFT social platforms, guild coordination tools and more,” Jain told The Defiant. As for innovating IP-driven business models, Jain told The Defiant he is really interested in new IP models coming out of the decentralized music and science industries. “Music remains one of the most under-monetized art forms when compared with its huge cultural impact,” he said. Decentralized music has gained traction over the past year with music NFT startups like Royal spearheading the movement.']"

['Three Arrows’ Su Zhu Breaks Silence Accusing Liquidators of Playing Dirty'],"['Su Zhu alleges liquidators failed to claim StarkWare tokens before a July 5 deadline. By: Aleksandar Gilbert Su Zhu, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, has accused the hedge fund’s liquidators of operating in bad faith, breaking a month-long silence during which his firm suffered a stunning fall from grace. “Sadly, our good faith to cooperate with the Liquidators was met with baiting,” Zhu wrote. The tweet included screenshots of a pair of emails his attorney had sent liquidator Russell Crumpler of Teneo. The last time Zhu tweeted or otherwise posted any public comments was on June 14, as rumors swirled that his $10B fund was insolvent. At the time, Su tweeted cryptically, “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out.” Who those parties were and what “this” was were left unsaid. But it didn’t take much time for people to figure it out. Since that tweet, Three Arrows has defaulted on a $700M loan, been ordered by a court to liquidate and filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy. All the while, Zhu and co-founder Kyle Davies have gone dark, ignoring media inquiries and allegedly ghosting creditors and even the court-appointed liquidators, who have taken control of the fund. The liquidators aired their frustrations in a court document filed Friday. An “introductory Zoom call” was arranged with Zhu and Davies, according to the document. People “identifying themselves as ‘Su Zhu’ and ‘Kyle’ were present on the Zoom call,” but “their video was turned off and they were on mute at all times with neither of them speaking despite questions being posed to them directly.” Teneo lawyers said the co-founders’ whereabouts are unknown and that a Three Arrows office in Singapore was locked and empty during a visit in late June. The lawyers also warned of an “actual and imminent risk that [Three Arrows’] assets may be transferred or otherwise disposed of by parties other than [Teneo] to the detriment of the Debtor, its creditors, and all other interested parties.” In the emails Zhu posted on Twitter Tuesday, Christopher Anand Daniel, of Singapore-based Advocatus Law LLP, said Su and Davies were doing their best, given the circumstances: the pair have “received threats of physical violence” and have been racing to answer questions from Singapore’s central bank, which announced last month that it was investigating Three Arrows “in light of recent developments which call into question the solvency of the fund.” In a separate email, Daniel took issue with the liquidators’ stewardship of the company. Three Arrows had a claim on tokens to be issued by crypto firm StarkWare. Daniel alleged Teneo did not claim the tokens before a July 5 deadline, causing “the Company to lose substantial value.” Teneo and Daniel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Observers were left to speculate as to why Teneo might have declined or failed to claim the tokens. “A tradfi liquidator could reasonably believe that their goal is to recover what they have and not focus on getting tokens in a start-up, but seems weird not to exercise the warrant assuming strike price (actual cost to 3AC) is de minimis?” wrote BuckyCantor, a self-described crypto lawyer. Another observer offered a theory in response. “I suspect this is because Liquidators aren’t crypto native and are reluctant to throw real USD after tokens which may not be saleable,” wrote Twitter user WassieLawyer. “Their mandate is to liquidate; not to keep running 3AC as a business.”']"

By: Owen Fernau It’s the gift that keeps on giving, or rather, people kept on giving to Three Arrows Capital. The saga goes on as revelations about creditors of the crypto hedge fund continue to pour in. The latest twist — Three Arrows Capital (3AC) owes $270M to Blockchain.com, as reported by CoinDesk. Blockchain.com is a crypto platform that features an exchange, a wallet, and an institutional arm. The news comes eight days after the Monetary Authority of Singapore released a statement outlining 3AC’s failures to comply with regulations. And just one day earlier, The Defiant reported on the official liquidation of the hedge fund. It’s been an unbelievable fall from grace for 3AC, whose founders were generally regarded as wizards of the past crypto bull run. Comments on co-founder Su Zhu’s podcast appearances lauded the hedge fund manager’s trading abilities and his tweets have become the stuff of legend after 3AC’s collapse. Zhu also coined the phrase “supercycle” — the idea that institutional adoption of digital assets would prevent the crypto markets from repeating the collapses of 2018 and 2014. The fallout continued after Voyager Digital announced 3AC’s default on a $700M loan on June 27 and Kyber Network called out 3AC for not returning $7.9M in treasury funds on June 23. And all while the fund’s co-founder, Su Zhu, was tweeting positively as 3AC dumped stETH. With the latest news that Blockchain.com may also be on the losing end after loaning 3AC money, the crypto world is still grappling with the apparent total disregard for risk management at one of its formerly most influential players.']"

['Voyager Delivers Painful Lesson on Perils of Counterparty Risk in Bankruptcy Drama'],"['Exposure to Three Arrows Sinks Crypto Exchange as Dominoes Fall By: Aleksandar Gilbert In late June, the top executives at Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency exchange with 3.5M users, knew they were in deep trouble. Three Arrows Capital, the Singapore-based hedge fund, owed it hundreds of millions worth of crypto and showed no signs of servicing the debt. Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich and his team embarked on a mad scramble to save their four-year-old company from the type of bank run that is wreaking havoc across the crypto sector. They hired lawyers. They hired a Wall Street Investment bank to rustle up a potential savior. And they reached out to Alameda Research, the trading firm co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire crypto impresario. It agreed to provide Voyager with $200M in cash and a revolving credit line financed by 15,000 Bitcoin even though Voyager was under enormous stress. What happened next is a cautionary tale about the perils of counterparty risk, and how crypto, despite the promise of blockchain technology, is not immune to the same dangers and mistakes that have long plagued traditional finance. In 2021, Voyager Digital raked in $415M in revenue, a 59-fold jump from the previous year. Just five months later the company, which is based in Jersey City, NJ, and has $1.3B of assets, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was the latest victim in the cryptocurrency crash of 2022. Yet the story of how it fell, and what comes next, may show how the industry can pick itself up and get back on its feet. “The Debtors are facing a short-term ‘run on the bank’ due to the downturn in the cryptocurrency industry generally and the default of a significant loan made to a third party,” Ehrlich said in the dry language of a filing made in bankruptcy court in New York. “But the Debtors have a viable business and a plan for the future.” Everything started to change in March. Co-founded in 2018 by Ehrlich and a trio of Wall Street and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Voyager was one of many platforms that married TradFi experience to the crypto game. The firm had a three-part business model: It provided brokerage services to crypto traders; custodial services that held onto crypto for customers and paid them with interest; and lending cryptocurrencies, with profits funding the interest payments. That month, Voyager was sitting on about $6B worth of outstanding cryptocurrency loans to clients even though the firm, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, had a market capitalization of just $64M, according to court filings. Borrowers included Genesis Global Capital, Wintermute Trading, and Galaxy Digital. Alameda Research had borrowed $377M at rates ranging from 1 to 11.5%, the court papers show. The imbalance was bad. Even worse, Voyager’s newest major counterparty was Three Arrows Capital, the hedge fund that had cut a swath through crypto to amass $10B in assets and investments in top tier projects such as Solana, Avalanche, and, most meaningfully, Terra. In March, Voyager had loaned Three Arrows 15,250 Bitcoin and $350M worth of USDC, a stablecoin, which, taken together, were worth about $1B. The timing couldn’t have been poorer as crypto, along with stocks, tumbled into a severe bear market. When Terra’s stablecoin, UST, suddenly slipped its peg in early May, it triggered a chain reaction of failures across its ecosystem of interlocking tokens and wiped out the $60B project. In a declaration filed as part of Voyager’s bankruptcy, Ehrlich said he and his management team immediately grew concerned about Three Arrows’ exposure to Terra. On June 22, Voyager demanded that Three Arrows pay back $658M worth of debt in five days or face default. It also tapped Alameda Research’s credit line for $75M, yet to no avail. “The Alameda loan facility was only a partial solution to the company’s liquidity issues,” Ehrlich said in his declaration. In the meantime, Voyager had hired Kirkland & Ellis, a powerful corporate law firm, and Moelis & Co., a Wall Street investment bank, to find a white knight who could provide “potential sources of new liquidity.” To that end, Jake Dermont, the head of the financial institutions group at Moelis, and his team solicited 60 potential partners in the investing industry with interests in cryptocurrency that might be receptive to a strategic deal with Voyager. Twenty of those firms signed confidentiality agreements and combed through thousands of pages of Voyager’s financial records to assess the company, the court record show. Moelis also shopped Voyager as an acquisition target. Yet only one potential suitor agreed to made a proposal for financing Voyager outside the scope of a bankruptcy proceeding. But it wasn’t accepted. “Potential counterparties expressed concerns regarding current uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market,” Dermont said in a declaration filed with the bankruptcy court. Now Ehrlich, a capital markets veteran and the CEO of ETrade Professional Trading from 2002 to 2006, must shepherd the company through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a court-supervised process that lets companies resolve outstanding debt and restructure its operations. Ehrlich insists Voyager isn’t going anywhere and that it can continue operations. Voyager has already asked the court for permission to continue paying its 351 employees and to continue honoring some debit card transactions at its own discretion. It’s holding more than $110M in cash and crypto assets, $350M of customers’ money and $1.3B “of crypto assets on its platform.” It hopes to bolster those numbers by recovering some of what it is owed by Three Arrows. Yet Three Arrows itself is also bankrupt, and it’s unclear how and if Voyager, which is just one of many creditors, will ever recover a significant portion of the $654M debt. As for Alameda Research, it’s now Voyager’s No. 1 creditor, with $75M on the line, according to the court papers. Ehrlich notes that he and his team have considerable experience in handling market volatility. And Wall Street history is loaded with cases where one or two firms can crack and rock the entire market. That this has now happened in crypto is a poignant moment in the evolution of this young industry. “The eventual implosion from Terra and Three Arrows Capital, and the resulting fallout, created the ‘cryptopaclypse,’” Ehrlich said in the declaration. As Voyager Digital joins the list of fallen platforms, the focus will shift to which one is next.']"

The company made the announcement on July 1, nine days after it called for Three Arrows Capital, the $10B troubled crypto hedge fund, to pay back a $658M debt. “We have taken steps to avoid this outcome,” Stephen Ehrlich, CEO at Voyager tweeted, “but the failure of a borrower, Three Arrows Capital, to repay a substantial loan from us makes this the right path forward.” Ehrlich went on to say that the decision will give the company time to strengthen its balance sheet. Voyager said in an unaudited balance sheet update presented as part of its press release, that it has loaned assets worth over $1.1B, a figure that includes the loan to 3AC, while it holds $685M of assets, $355M of customers’ cash, and $168M of crypto collateral.

By: Aleksandar Gilbert FTX, the second-biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has signed an option to purchase crypto lender BlockFi for as much as $240M, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said Friday. The agreement, which Prince said was signed Thursday, is subject to shareholder approval and would also grant BlockFi a $400M credit line. The deal gives FTX “an option to acquire BlockFi at a variable price of up to $240M based on performance triggers.” Prince did not say what those triggers were in a Twitter thread announcing the agreement. As crypto platforms buckle under the pressure of a collapsing market, Thursday’s move may calm BlockFi customers worried the firm would be the next to fall. The announcement quashes rumors that FTX had offered to buy BlockFi for just $25M. Prince denied that was true in a tweet Thursday. Nevertheless, the news represents a stunning reversal of fortune for BlockFi, which was valued at $5B last year. Prince stressed customers were at no risk of losing their money. But turmoil at crypto titans Celsius and Three Arrows Capital prompted BlockFi’s search for a savior, he said. Celsius, a direct competitor with BlockFi, halted customer withdrawals last month, citing market turmoil, a move that “started an uptick in client withdrawals from BlockFi’s platform despite us having no exposure to them,” Prince said. Then, as Three Arrows imploded, BlockFi lost $80M, Prince continued. “This represents the full extent of the impact to BlockFi from 3AC,” the CEO explained. “We have no further exposure and the limited losses we did experience will be absorbed by BlockFi with no impact to client funds.” The $400M credit line is the second FTX has offered BlockFi in recent weeks. Last month, FTX gave BlockFi a $250M credit line, feeding rumors it might go the way of Celsius. FTX has emerged as a lender of last resort in the crypto world, offering credit to or outright acquiring distressed companies. Last year, it provided Liquid, a Japanese crypto exchange, $120M in financing after it suffered a $100M hack. FTX later purchased Liquid for an undisclosed amount of money. More recently, Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm Bankman-Fried founded in 2017, gave Voyager Capital a line of credit worth almost $500M. On Friday, Voyager announced it would, like Celsius, temporarily halt customer withdrawals “to preserve the value of the Voyage platform.” Prince and FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried have repeatedly stressed BlockFi was on solid footing, a message Prince repeated in Friday’s announcement.“We have not drawn on this credit facility to date and have continued to operate all our products and services normally,” he said. “It was important to add capital to our balance sheet to bolster liquidity and protect client funds.”']"

By: Aleksandar Gilbert Authorities in Singapore are investigating troubled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, the country’s central bank announced Thursday. The Monetary Authority of Singapore in a press release “reprimanded” Three Arrows for “providing false information” regarding its assets under management and said it suspected further foul play. “In light of recent developments which call into question the solvency of the fund managed by TAC, MAS is assessing if there were further breaches by TAC of MAS’ regulations,” MAS said. It was not immediately clear what punishment Three Arrows might face for having allegedly misled regulators. But the news comes just one week after Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at MAS, said Singapore would be “brutal and unrelentingly hard” on crypto companies that engage in “market bad behavior.” In recent weeks, Three Arrows, a onetime high-flying institution that evangelized for a “super-cycle” in crypto, has suffered heavy losses from major positions in Terra’s failed UST stablecoin, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and Lido’s staked ether. The firm’s standing deteriorated even further Monday, when a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered its liquidation. The $10B fund will be taken over and its assets distributed among creditors by Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer of Teneo, a New York-based consulting firm appointed by the court. Three Arrows, founded 10 years ago in Singapore, was a “registered fund management company,” according to the MAS, and allowed no more than 30 investors and 250M Singapore dollars ($180M) under management. The MAS alleges Three Arrows exceeded its limit on assets under management twice: between July and September of 2020 and between November 2020 and August 2021. The central bank also alleges Three Arrows gave it misleading information in April of this year, when the firm said it had, several months prior, “novated the management of the only fund it managed to an offshore entity in the British Virgin Islands.” In reality, MAS said, Three Arrows and the offshore entity “shared a common shareholder” in Three Arrows co-founder Su Zhu.

It overtook dYdX as the second-largest L2. Arbitrum, Ethereum’s leading L2 with a $2B TVL and 51% market share, is also seeing increased usage amid its multi-week onboarding event, Odyssey. Trade activity on Optimism is also booming, with its monthly trailing DEX volume up 254% with $1.5B exchanges over the past 30 days, according to Dune Analytics. By contrast, combined DEX volume across all chains is down 50% over the past week. Why the surge? It’s hard to be sure, but the recent swoon in the market has frequently driven transaction fees on Ethereum DEXes up to hundreds of dollars. This suggests many on-chain traders may be moving their assets on Optimism to capture savings. The increased adoption of Optimism and Arbitrum also comes as the initial hype surrounding the broader L2 landscape appears to have died down. Speculators were extremely bullish on Ethereum’s L2-based scaling roadmap in late 2021, but the bear market has wreaked carnage for smaller projects as traders scramble to consolidate liquidity Loopring and Boba Network have shed nearly $2B in combined TVL since November, and dYdX is planning to leave Ethereum and launch as an independent blockchain built on Cosmos.

"[""Solend and Mango Markets Team Up to Handle Whale's $207M Debt""]","['Scramble to Protect No. 1 Lender on Solana Shifts into New Phase By: Samuel Haig Risky debt is spreading across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem as the drama around a whale and Solend shifts into a new phase. Solend, the top lending protocol on Solana, has agreed with rival, Mango Markets, to share the debts of its largest user — an unidentified whale holding $207.3M of SOL, according to governance proposals. The sum comprised one quarter of Solend’s total value locked (TVL) and posed a threat to the protocol. On June 22, the whale paid down $11.5M of the debt, according to Solend.\xa0It’s unclear exactly how much has been paid back in the last few days. “This shows commitment to working things out and solves Solend’s USDC utilization problem… We’re in touch with the Mango team and [the whale] to figure out a long-term plan,” Solend posted. “This doesn’t completely solve the problem however, since the large liquidation wall still exists,” the team added, meaning a big chunk of the position may still be subject to a margin call. Mango’s move to save Solend has not come without criticism from its community. Daffy Durairaj, Mango’s co-founder, posted a summary of the plan and risks it may pose to the protocol’s community forum. “Most of you probably know there is a borrower with 6m SOL collateral who is looking to borrow 150m+ in stable coins,” the post said. “He had his entire position on Solend, but has recently started moving some of it into Mango and other protocols. We will have some additional risks If the borrower deposits his collateral into Mango and max borrows USDC.” On June 19, the Solend team warned that action must be taken to address the risks associated with the account of its largest whale, who had taken out loans of USDC and USDT worth $108M against 5.7M SOL tokens. Solend estimated that the account represented 95% of SOL deposits, 88% of USDC borrowed, and a quarter of the dApp’s TVL. The team said a further 20% drop in SOL’s price to $22.30 would result in the position beginning to be liquidated, but that the size of the position could have such a significant price impact that Solend may find itself holding bad debt. Solend said it had unsuccessfully attempted to contact the whale since June 13 via on-chain messaging and public Twitter posts. SOL has since bounced with the broader crypto markets, jumping almost 3% in the last 24 hours in midday trading U.K. time, according to CoinGecko. The news came as the stress on DeFi lending intensifies. The struggles of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital to manage loan obligations have become a crisis amid the bear market. A June 19 proposal from Solend to take control of the whale’s account was quickly passed by governance before being abandoned after the team was hotly criticized by decentralization proponents. A new plan to introduce debt limits resulting in progressive liquidation for loans exceeding $50M was passed on June 21. It appeared the whale was shifting assets. That same day, Solend tweeted that USDC utilization had begun to drop from 100%, allowing users to withdraw the stablecoin from the protocol again. The Solend team said the whale had begun to spread the position onto other lending platforms after $25M USDC in debt was shifted onto Solana’s Mango Markets. Durairaj said the whale is looking to borrow $150M in stablecoins, stating the protocol may increase its maximum annual interest rate from 150% to 300% should the whale utilize 100% of USDC in the protocol. He noted the risk of the whale’s position being too large to be liquidated without incurring severe slippage in the event of significant price losses for SOL, meaning the protocol may be left with insufficient collateral to repay the debt in the event of a crash. Such an event could threaten to deplete Mango’s 10M USDC insurance fund and possibly result in socialized losses for USDC depositors, although Durairaj said Mango DAO’s $60M in treasury assets could also be used to pay off losses or provide a liquidity buffer. Twitter user Fat_Crypto_Losr responded that Mango should limit the sum of stablecoins available to the whale. “I care what happens to Mango, I care what happens to Sol. If we’re not ready for this level of action don’t take it,” they tweeted. Durairaj replied that limits will be introduced alongside mango’s v4 iteration and that Mango should use its upgrade council sparingly in the meantime. “People should remove their deposits from Mango if they think the risks are too high,” the co-founder added. Many in the Solend community remain unhappy with the situation despite Mango alleviating some of the risk by taking on a portion of the whale’s position. Smolsmooth said “yeah they listened to you[r] suggestion basically at gun point. Don’t spin this as if it was optional, and they choose to do so. This whole fiasco makes the protocol look like a circus.” RedCryptoPanda tweeted “I’m still [in] awe you could actually step in and take control of the funds. Just mind blowing. Shouldn’t even be possible.” The incident has dethroned Solend as Solana’s largest DeFi protocol by TVL. The dApp is now Solana’s third largest with $243.6M after declining by 58% over 30 days and 32% for the past week — the weakest performance among Solana’s top 25 protocols, according to DeFi Llama. Serum, a decentralized exchange, is now Solana’s largest dApp with $293.6M, followed by liquid staking protocol Marinade Finance with $254.5M.

The fund owes a crypto exchange called Voyager Digital the sum — and shows no signs of paying it back, the exchange said Wednesday in an extraordinary statement. Voyager Digital, a Vancouver-based concern, said it may issue a notice of default to Three Arrows for “failure to repay its loan.” The company said Three Arrows owes it 15,250 Bitcoins, which were worth more than $308M in midday trading New York time.

The situation is taking a toll on Voyager Digital — its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange plummeted 60% Wednesday to 67 cents per share. Voyager said it has about $152M in cash and crypto assets on hand, as well as $20M it can only use for the purchase of USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Details on Debt Woes in $10B Crypto Fund Are Hard to Come By In a news release, Voyager said it had asked Three Arrows to repay $25M in USDC by Friday, “and subsequently requested repayment of the entire balance of USDC and BTC by June 27, 2022.” Three Arrows has been whipsawed this month, as rumors swirled about potential insolvency and founders Kyle Davies and Zhu Su ghosting creditors.\xa0Three Arrows has yet to return the money, Voyager said, and “failure by 3AC to repay either requested amount by these specified dates will constitute an event of default.” “Voyager intends to pursue recovery from 3AC and is in discussions with the Company’s advisors regarding the legal remedies available,” the company stated. Three Arrows did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Drew Pierson, vice president of communications at Voyager, pointed to the company’s news release and public filings when reached for comment. At the same time, Voyager announced a deal with Alameda Ventures, a crypto investment firm, to receive $200M in cash and a revolving credit line financed by 15,000 Bitcoin.\xa0“The proceeds of the credit facility are intended to be used to safeguard customer assets in light of current market volatility and only if such use is needed,” said Voyager. Voyager and Alameda had agreed to the transaction prior to the trouble with Three Arrows, the company said.']"

['Celsius Defies Fear of Implosion as Token Soars 218%'],"['Short Squeeze Targets Investors Who Bet Against CEL By: Owen Fernau After crypto lending platform Celsius suspended withdrawals of deposits last week, it seemed unlikely that its native token would move higher. Yet the crypto bank’s CEL token has soared 218% since June 13. What gives? A short squeeze, that’s what. CEL has spiked since withdrawals were suspended. Source: CoinGecko It appears that investors have joined forces and started buying the token to put pressure on short sellers who were profiting from Celsius’ troubles. The move brings to mind the squeeze meme stonks fans exerted on hedge funds who’d sold short GameStop back in early 2021. The hashtag “#CelShortSqueeze” has gained momentum on Twitter. According to the developing narrative, investors have targeted the CEL shorts as the same actors who triggered the ‘bank run’ which caused Celsius to freeze withdrawals. A so-called short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted asset starts rising in price, usually fueled by retail buyers. Investors who had been betting on the price to continue falling are then forced to cover their positions, adding buy pressure. This squeeze appears to be focused on removing CEL from the giant cryptoexchange FTX, where there is apparently limited CEL liquidity. A Dune Analytics dashboard details the amount of CEL tokens left on FTX. According to the query, the amount of available CEL has dropped by over a million tokens in the last two days. Source: Dune Analytics This is important because without an adequate supply of CEL tokens on FTX, subsequent buys will push the price up higher relative to if there was deep liquidity. As short sellers must buy back CEL in order to cover their positions, these buys could raise the price given the relatively low liquidity. In turn, this leads to the price pumping, leaving the remaining short sellers even further in the red and at risk of liquidation if these trades were made on margin Of course, those looking to maximize profit will have a split-second to time the absolute top. GameStop’s GME spiked 400% to $325 in a single week in January 2021 before falling back to earth a week later.']"

By: Aleksandar Gilbert BlockFi, a crypto lending platform, has secured a revolving line of credit of $250M with FTX, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume, leaders of both companies said Tuesday. BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said the credit would be used “as needed” and would be “subordinate to all client balances across all account types.” The move was announced only days after Prince took to Twitter to quell rumors the lending platform, with about $15B in assets under management, would go the way of competitor Celsius, which froze withdrawals on its accounts. Crypto traders have become concerned plummeting digital asset prices and turmoil in multi-billion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which have already destabilized firms including Celsius and Babel Finance, could cause other dominoes to fall. Some investors worried BlockFi could be one of them. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried tried to ease investors’ concerns. “BlockFi customer assets are appropriately managed, with no debt/risk from 3AC, Celsius, etc.,” Bankman-Fried tweeted. “BlockFi is financially strong; all operations are normal, as they always have been, and assets are safe.” Last week, while Prince insisted BlockFi’s financials were strong, the company laid off 20% of its workforce It’s not the first time that SBF, as Bankman-Fried is known, has stepped in to assist floundering crypto firms. Last year, FTX provided Liquid, a Japanese crypto exchange, $120M in financing after it suffered a $100M hack. FTX later purchased Liquid for an undisclosed amount of money. More recently, Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm Bankman-Fried founded in 2017, gave Voyager Capital a line of credit worth almost $500M. Jake Chervinsky, head of policy at the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group, disputed the characterization of FTX’s line of credit as a “bailout.” “Private companies doing a private deal is the exact opposite of a bailout,” he tweeted. “This is how capitalism is supposed to work in times of market stress. No government intervention necessary.” In a recent interview with NPR, Bankman-Fried said FTX has a responsibility “to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion.” “I think that’s what’s healthy for the ecosystem, and I want to do what can help it grow and thrive,” he said.']"

The new and instant trade functionality is called an atomic exchange. “Several months ago, SIP-120 was implemented allowing for atomic execution by using Uniswap as a secondary price oracle,” Kain Warwick told The Defiant. “After some further work to improve execution efficiency and coordination with integrators, 1inch began routing orders through Curve+Synthetix and volume took off.” Warwick added that this was a feature for Ethereum’s Layer 1, and that Synth trades on Optimism, the Layer 2 (L2), are atomic by default. Synthetix has also added perpetual futures in March, which the protocol’s Twitter account has cited as another reason for its recent momentum. Warwick is aiming higher.

"[""Solend to Not Freeze Whale's $216M Account After Move Decried as 'Opposite of DeFi'""]","['The Money Market dApp on Solana is Anxious About Liquidation Exposure By: Samuel Haig Solend, a money market dApp and the largest Solana-based protocol, is scrambling to address exposure from a whale that’s holding 5.7M SOL worth $215.7M, according to governance proposals. Over the last three days, Solend’s community has approved a plan to take control of the whale’s account, then reversed course after the move was criticized by decentralization advocates, and is now weighing a third proposal to introduce account limits that will result in borrowed positions exceeding $50M being progressively liquidated. The flurry of action comes as fears of liquidations continue to roil the DeFi market. Solana has rallied alongside Ether, jumping 34% in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko. Yet investors and protocols remain jittery about fallout from loanbooks backed by digital assets. Solend’s token, SLND, has tumbled almost 16% in the last seven days. That’s what spooked the Solend community. On June 19, the whale’s loans of 108M USDC and USDT were backed by $170M worth of SOL, meaning that a further drawdown of 20% would result in part of collateral being liquidated. The Solend team estimated that the account represented 95% of SOL deposits, 88% of USDC borrowed, and a quarter of the total value locked in the dApp’s protocol.The team said if SOL’s price fell to $22.30, a fifth of the whale’s account would be subject to liquidation. With liquidations occuring in the form of market orders executed on decentralized exchanges with relatively thin liquidity, Solend worried that the price impact caused by liquidating the whale’s SOL may be so large that it could result in the protocol failing to recover enough USDC and USDT to pay down the account’s debts. “It’d be difficult for the market to absorb such an impact since liquidators generally market sell on DEXes. In the worst case, Solend could end up with bad debt,” Solend warned. Solend is Solana’s largest protocol, representing 11% of the network’s total value locked (TVL) with a $286.4M TVL, according to DeFi Llama. On June 19, Solend put together its first ever governance proposal suggesting it take control of the whale’s account, warning that its loan position could pose a systemic threat to Solend and the broader Solana ecosystem. Entitled SLND1, the proposal quickly passed with more than 97% support from SLND tokenholders. But the move was widely criticized by crypto investors as a blow to decentralization. Anthony Sassano of The Daily Gwei podcast described the proposal as “the very opposite of DeFi,” and “even worse” than TradFi.“Normally you hear about accounts getting frozen in TradFi, you don’t really hear about accounts being taken over and the money being… seized unless it’s part of some criminal case,” he said. Others weighed in. “I think it’s great we can vote to liquidate whales and take over their assets,” tweeted crypto_bitlord7. “This is what decentralisation is truly about.”\xa0Clickityclack5 commented “wasn’t Solana supposed to handle more tps than visa? Why tf is it getting crippled by one whale liquidation?” In response, the Solend team launched a second proposal seeking to reverse SLND1. It also extended Solend’s governance voting period to one day. “The price of SOL has been steadily increasing, buying us some time to gather more feedback and consider alternatives,” the proposal said. It passed with 99.8% support. The community is now voting on a third proposal advocating for the introduction of a $50M borrowing limit on accounts, with all positions exceeding the limit set to be progressively liquidated. The account limit would be gradually introduced starting from $120M and reduced by $500,000 each hour. The proposal would also temporarily change the maximum amount of a position that can be liquidated from 20% to 1% to ease the impact of the liquidations on orderbooks. “Due to the need to move quickly, consider the 24 hour voting period as notice for users to reduce their borrow positions,” the team added. The proposal appears likely to pass, with 99% of 431,771 votes cast in favor so far.']"

['TVL in DeFi Fails to Keep Pace with Rebounding Ether'],"['Key Metric May Signal Fading Confidence in Sector By: Samuel Haig In a sign that investors may be losing confidence in the long term prospects of DeFi, the total value locked in the sector’s protocols has increased just 5% even though the price of Ether has rebounded 30% since bottoming out on June 18. That means users are continuing to remove assets from DeFi even though token prices are starting to recover. The bear market has exposed the risks in many popular DeFi products, with algorithmic stablecoins, yield farms, and staking derivatives among the hardest hit. Algorithmic stablecoins are not backed by collateral, meaning they can quickly post spiralling losses should they fail to remain pegged to the dollar. Staking derivatives are also vulnerable to losing price parity with the underlying assets they represent. Terra Classic and UST are no more, and other algorithmic stablecoins are struggling to maintain their peg. Lido’s stETH staking derivative also lost its peg, while farmed tokens have posted extreme losses in recent weeks. The TVL in DeFi protocols has plunged 71% to $73.2B since early December, according to DeFi Llama. The Ethereum network represents nearly two-thirds of the sector’s combined TVL. However, Ethereum’s locked value is still down more than $100B in seven months since its high of $160B. The spectacular collapse of Terra made way for Binance Smart Chain to reclaim the position of DeFi’s second-largest chain, currently representing a TVL of $6B. Tron is among the few networks that grew during the recent downtrend, rising to third place with $4B locked. Its ascension came despite controversy surrounding its UST-style algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, and purported shift to overcollateralization. But the drama culminated in Tron shedding more than one-third of its value over just two days, slipping from $6B on June 19 as users pulled capital from its dominant dapp, JustLend. The low-cost Layer 1 networks that surged during late 2021 have been among the hardest hit by the DeFi crash. The TVLs of Avalanche, Solana, and Fantom have each bled more than $9B from their 2022 highs, currently representing $2.6B, $2.5B, and $967M respectively. The collateralized debt protocol MakerDAO is the largest DeFi protocol with about $8B locked. Curve, the decentralized stablecoin exchange that dominated DeFi towards the end of the bull run with a $24B TVL, now ranks third with $5B. The sector’s combined market cap has also underperformed Ether, bouncing just 10% from a June 19 low of $33.5B, according to CoinGecko. Ether’s market value has climbed 30% to $140B.']"

"[""Investors Scramble to Get a Grip on Depth of Three Arrows' Trouble""]","['Details on Debt Woes in $10B Crypto Fund Are Hard to Come By By: Jason Levin The fear is palpable. Six weeks after Terra collapsed and one week after Celsius, the embattled crypto bank, suspended withdrawals, investors are anxiously watching a $10B hedge fund cope with serious stress. Three Arrows Capital is sitting on what are believed to be billions of dollars worth loans secured by cryptocurrencies. With the market down 56% this year in its worst bear market since 2018, investors believe the collateral no longer supports the loans. Now the fund is on the hook to start paying them back, and everyone is wondering whether it will default. On Wednesday, The Defiant reported that Three Arrows sold at least $40M worth of staked Ether as part of an apparent liquidation. It is widely believed that co-founder Su Zhu has been aggressive in using leverage to maximize his potential investment returns. “If 3AC were to become insolvent, it would be catastrophic,” The DeFi Edge, an investor with 175,000+ followers on Twitter, told The Defiant. “Zhu believed in the super cycle and used a ton of leverage to increase their position size.If the firm cannot pay off its positions, it’ll force more liquidations.” Three Arrows has not responded to requests for comment by The Defiant. On June 15, Zhu alluded to the fund’s troubles in a tweet. “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out,” he said.In the meantime, crypto players have been poring over blockchain data and analysis to garner some sense of Three Arrows exposure, and what might happen next. On June 15, Danny Yuan, Head of Trading at 8 Blocks Capital, tweeted that Three Arrows removed nearly $1M from his firm’s trading account. The two companies worked together for 1.5 years, but Yuan explained that when his team tried calling 3AC’s Operations Team about the $1M withdrawal, they ignored their calls. “What we learned is that they were leveraged long everywhere and were getting margin-called,” Yuan tweeted. “Instead of answering the margin calls, they ghosted everyone. The platforms had no choice but to liquidate their positions, causing the markets to further dump.” Three Arrows, which is based in Singapore, has become a force in DeFi by backing some of its most important platforms. It’s invested in Solana, Avalanche, Aave and Terra, as well as GameFi names such as Axie Infinity and NFTs. Zhu made his name as a crypto bull championing the idea of a “super-cycle” in which Bitcoin would hit $2.5M and become a new form of gold. He believed the digital assets market would sidestep a bearish turn thanks to blockchain innovation.On May 27, with the market cratering after Terra’s stablecoin, UST, lost its peg, Zhu admitted he was wrong. “Supercycle price thesis regrettably wrong,” he tweeted. “But crypto will still thrive and change the world everyday.” Now investors are wondering, and hoping, that Three Arrows survives. If it can’t service its debts that would be a severe blow to a market already struggling to find its footing. Yet it’s hard to get a bead on precisely what’s going on inside the firm. Just like TradFi hedge funds, Three Arrows doesn’t share much about its inner workings. What is certain is the fear its struggles are triggering in the marketplace. “When everyone’s rushing for the most liquid thing in the room, the leverage gets unwound and just triggers the next domino,” Messari analyst Chase Devens told The Defiant.']"

Ether was up 9.2% in mid-morning trading U.K. time, and Bitcoin jumped 5.2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The platform’s DeFi index, comprising top names in the sector such as Solana and Uniswap, ended its recent plunge as its market capitalization jumped almost 5%. Investors appeared to be relieved by the Federal Reserve’s action to dampen inflation, which hit 8.6% in May and tipped the S&P 500 into a bear market. The Fed signalled that rate hikes of this magnitude would not be commonplace going forward. As they have for months, cryptocurrencies moved in line with stocks, which jumped after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points, its largest increase since 1994. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said another increase of this magnitude would not be likely at the Fed’s next meeting. Bitcoin and Ether gained more than 2%, with BTC posting its first 24-hour gain in over a week.

Something happens and the market knows… This is going to be a long-term bummer. This time that something is called Celsius. And with the news of the CeFi exchange’s decision to suspend withdrawals this week, the crypto market turned a rout into something much worse: another potential nuclear winter.

Even more jarring, on Monday ETH slipped below its all-time high during the rally of early 2018.

Tokens wallowed in the doldrums from 2018 to 2020 after the initial coin offering bubble burst.

(A bear market typically unfolds when prices drop 20% over at least two months).The correlation between crypto and stocks has become one of the most startling developments in the last year. Bitcoin, of course, should be the ultimate inflation hedge because it is disconnected from central bank policymaking, interest rates, and other devices in TradFi.

['Uh-oh! Tron’s Stablecoin USDD Slips its Peg as TRX Tumbles'],"['More Trouble is Brewing in Stablecoin Market By: Samuel Haig Tron’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD appears to be in trouble despite recent moves from the Tron DAO to overcollateralize the token. The supposedly stable USDD token lost its peg to the U.S. dollar amid market turmoil. According to CoinGecko, the token is now changing hands for $0.98. TRX also slumped more than 25% in 12 hours from June 13 to June 14, sparking fears the token may be on the verge of its own death spiral. USDD is not the only stablecoin to slide below $1 as the markets sold off. Top centralized stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USD Coin) dropped to $0.995 and $0.099 respectively, while leading decentralized stable token DAI oscillated between roughly $0.99 and $1.02 during the market carnage. Binance USD and TUSD also bounced between less than $0.99 and $1.02, while USDN last changed hands for $0.96, and VAI is trading for just $0.945. USDD is Tron’s answer to Terra’s notorious failed algorithmic stablecoin, UST, which offered roughly 20% annual yields when deposited into the Anchor protocol. UST’s yields were subsidized by a reserve, and redemptions were paid in $1 worth of Terra’s native LUNA token in a bid to incentivize arbitrageurs to defend its peg — a design that made the token vulnerable to the death-spiral that triggered the collapse of the Terra network. USDD is similarly redeemable for Tron’s native network token, TRX. While Tron originally offered annual “risk-free” yields of 30% to USDD stakers, the figure was later reduced to 10.9%. The token’s algorithmic backing was also bolstered by a purportedly overcollateralized model to protect against it entering a death-spiral. In response, Tron stepped in to protect both USDD and TRX. On June 13, the Tron DAO Reserve tweeted that it had received 700M USDC to defend the stablecoins peg. Tron claimed the injection had increased USDD’s collateralization ratio to almost 300%. Tron founder, Justin Sun, also posted that the funding rate for shorting TRX had surged to minus 500% amid the bearish price action. He said the Tron DAO Reserve would deploy $2B to “fight” the shorts, announcing that a “short squeeze is coming” and that he doubts leveraged TRX sellers will “last for even 24 hours.” It&#8217;s a bear market and investors are picky.

Many commentators have compared Sun’s moves to those of Terra founder Do Kwon. In May, Kwon scrambled to reassure Terra’s community as prices of LUNA and UST began to crumble. SafuXBT posted “deploying more capital – steady lads” at Sun, a direct quote from Kwon.

['Liquid Staking Providers Buck Bear Market With Hefty Inflows'],"['Data Shows $2.3B Flow Into Lido as Other Protocols Suffer Withdrawals By: Samuel Haig This has been a rough year for DeFi, with large sums of capital being withdrawn from most of the sector’s top protocols. Even so, liquid staking providers are among the few DeFi projects to post consistent growth. Leading liquid staking provider Lido has continued to absorb deposits despite suffering a heavy drop in total value locked (TVL) amid ETH’s recent losses, according to DeFi Llama. Lido took in more than $3.2B across six individual days during February and March. By contrast, just 15 daily outflows have been posted since the start of March. It’s not alone. Rival liquid staking provider, Rocket Pool, has also enjoyed consistent inflows during 2022, posting withdrawals for just three days of the year so far. So why are these projects, which help Ethereum stakers participate in processing its blockchain, bucking the downturn? It all has to do with Ethereum’s shift to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-Work transaction validation. Guest writer Tushar Aggarwal delves into the thorny problem of incompossibility and liquidity staking. The shift, expected in the third quarter, is poised to drive a significant increase in rewards for stakers as miners are booted from the network. But withdrawal functionality isn’t live yet on the Proof-of-Stake Eth2 Beacon Chain. That means liquid staking protocols are the only way for ETH stakers to exit their positions for the time being. Lido capital flows in 2022. Source: DeFi Llama Users have withdrawn billions from the DeFi protocols since April as the crypto markets suffered heavy drawdowns due to rising interest rates and investors fleeing risky assets. The collapse of Terra Classic and USTdidn’t help either. Now the Federal Reserve’s policy of quantitative tightening has spurred even more investors to withdraw capital from DeFi’s top protocols. Even blue chip MakerDAO is being whipsawed. It has shed $3B in the past two months despite reclaiming its position as the largest DeFi protocol.

Aave v3 has only posted a dozen daily outflows since launching in mid-March.

"[""Fed's Quantitative Tightening Program Poised to Whipsaw Crypto""]","['QT Ends Loose Money Era and Augurs More Pressure For Token Values By: Owen Fernau With crypto’s market cap already down $1T for the year, digital asset holders are hoping the bear market’s worst damage is done. They may be out of luck, however, as the U.S. Federal Reserve began quantitative tightening (QT) on June 1, according to a press release by the central bank. QT is a monetary policy tool with which the Fed decreases the amount of liquidity in the economy by allowing securities on its balance sheet to reach their maturity date. These securities are primarily Treasury bonds, whose debt is serviced by the U.S. government, and mortgage-backed securities. The first tranche of debt won’t mature until June 15, according to Alfonso Peccatiello, the former head of fixed income portfolio management at ING Deutschland, so the actual effects of QT have yet to hit the US economy. Further, the rate of balance sheet reduction will double from $47.5B for the next three months, to $95B in September. QT reverses the quantitative easing (QE) program that has reshaped the markets by flooding the economy with cash and Fed support, first during the global financial crash of 2008 and 2009, and then again during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The program increased the Fed’s balance sheet by roughly $4.8T in the wake of the pandemic, according to a report by the Fed. That number constitutes over half of the Fed’s total balance sheet, which stands at $8.92T as of June 6, according to the Federal Reserve Economic Data platform. Because crypto’s price movement has been tied to the amount of liquidity in the system, a further reduction in money supply by way of QT will probably be a new source of pressure on token valuations. The question is by how much? Number of ETH Wallets at Highest Level in 12 Months Economiser, a Twitter account billing itself as “examing DeFi and crypto from an econ angle,” suggested that QT’s effect may not be so dramatic. As evidence, Economiser referred The Defiant to research by the Fed equating the QT program to roughly a sustained 0.5% increase in interest rates in terms of its effect on the economy. “I expect demand for crypto from the U.S. to reduce slightly over the next 12 months, however I don’t think demand will drop massively,” Economiser told The Defiant. The economist also said they believed that BTC and ETH wouldn’t be affected differently by QT. Economiser added that there is reason to be concerned with regard to demand for crypto in emerging markets. “A lot of emerging markets borrowed significant amounts in 2020 and 2021 to fund the pandemic response,” the economist said. “Now with increased interest rates, the cost of servicing that debt is rising substantially.” Economiser added that Sri Lanka already defaulted on their debt in May. Others in the investment field aren’t as optimistic about QT. Ana Andrianova, a former investment banker and founder of Akropolis, a product which aims to provide simple access to yield-generating DeFi protocols, thinks QT could play a role in pushing the world into a serious economic downtown. “The impending recession will be unquestionably like nothing we have seen before,” Andrianova told The Defiant. “QT and a very real hyperinflation will strip the retail investors of the discretionary [cash] that fueled much of the 2020-2021 bull run.” The banker-turned-DeFi founder added that crypto is significantly more sensitive to retail capital inflows than more traditional markets. The effects of QT have yet to kick in. Bulls of course, hope the market has already priced in the information. Bears think we haven’t been hit yet. And of course, QT isn’t set in stone either — the Fed initiated a QT program in June 2017 though backed off earlier than expected in July 2019. In similar fashion, the current QT program comes with an asterix from the Fed in their May announcement: “The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments.”']"

['Flurry of Metrics Show Signs of Potential Recovery for ETH'],"['Number of ETH Wallets at Highest Level in 12 Months By: Samuel Haig Is the worst over for ETH? The Ethereum markets are giving mixed signals, with on-chain data indicating accumulation is underway in spite of bearish price action. The price of Ether slumped 6% overnight, erasing the gains posted during last week’s bounce from its seven-month low of $1,700. ETH has now dropped 63% from its November high of nearly $4,900. The pull-back follows a record streak of eight consecutive weekly red candles for Ethereum, with further drawdowns threatening to bring the total to nine.

On-chain data from Glassnode shows that some market participants are steadily increasing the size of their ETH bags, with the number of wallets holding at least 32 ETH or 100 ETH currently at their highest levels in more than 12 months. The sum of wallets containing more than 10 ETH is testing its all-time high posted in November 2020, while wallets holding more than 1 ETH are at record levels with 1.47M. The percent of Ethereum’s supply that is “in profit,” meaning it last moved on-chain when ETH was trading at a lower price, is at a 25-month low. The percent of Ethereum wallets in profit is similarly at a 22-month low, while the number of addresses that are at a loss based on a seven-day moving average has tagged a record high of roughly 35.17M. Despite persistent progress towards the Eth2 chain-merge and the network’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, Ether is trading at its lowest level against BTC since October last year. ETH/BTC Source: TradingView Another key metric hinting at Ether’s direction is the supply locked in smart contracts. It has remained steady despite the value locked in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem plummeting by $40B in May and $92B since December, according to DeFi Llama. More Ether remains locked in DeFi smart contracts than on centralized exchanges, which hold roughly 17% of the circulating ETH supply. Stakers also remain undeterred, with an all-time high of more than 12.7M Ether or 10.5% of ETH’s supply locked up on the Eth2 Beacon Chain. Ethereum ranks as the largest Proof of Stake network by staked capitalization with $23.1B, beating out Cardano by 9.4B according to StakingRewards.

The Total Value Locked (TVL) across the sector plummeted more than 40% in the month to $111.4B, according to data from DeFi Llama.

Terra airdropped Terra 2.0’s LUNA to holders of the network tokens of the fallen Terra Classic chain – what’s now known as Luna Classic (LUNC), and the network’s defunct native stablecoin, UST. The new LUNA token has doubled in value since May 29, last changing hands for $8.50, according to CoinGecko. LUNA has pulled back from a high of $11.45 earlier today. LUNC’s market cap is now $844M, a fraction of its $1.9B market cap in early May, just before UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar. Both LUNA and UST crashed together. To incentivize arbitrageurs, UST’s developers had hardcoded UST to be redeemable for $1 worth of LUNA regardless of UST’s price. So when UST crashed, the run on LUNA drove the network price into an aggressive death spiral. The new airdrop distributes tokens according to a two-year vesting schedule, and only 30% of the token’s supply is currently in circulation. Twitter user Cephii1 commented, “not much $LUNA circulating supply actually available… how crazy are people going to run it up?” The airdrop also copped flak for its distribution. On May 31, Terra tweeted that some users received less LUNA from the airdrop than they expected. Ashwsbreal tweeted, “lost $300k in $LUNA. Got an airdrop of $29. Thank you Do Kwon and team.” Terra said it’s working on a solution. The botched LUNA distribution may have been the result of its rushed execution. Terra critic and purported insider FatManTerra shared a tweet appearing to show chatlogs revealing that Terra founder Do Kwon prioritized the airdrop’s speed above all else. “I think any reasonable distribution is fine tbh,” Do Kwon allegedly posted. “The most important thing is to get something launched. It almost doesn’t matter how one designs it. We lose community every day we delay.” Other revelations continue to spook investors. On May 27, FatManTerra unearthed a $90M exploit targeting the network’s Mirror Protocol that had gone unnoticed since October of last year. Blockchain forensics firm BlockSec also corroborated the exploit. On May 29, a Terra community member shared transaction data indicating that the protocol is again under attack. They posted that Mirror had mistakenly hardcoded the value of LUNC to track the new LUNA’s price. While LUNA last traded for more than $9, LUNC is worth about one-hundredth of a cent. This allows opportunistic users to use LUNC as collateral to borrow much more than they should be able to.. FatManTerra estimated that $1.3M worth of assets could be withdrawn from the platform against just $1,000 worth of LUNC. They noted that traders have drained Mirror’s mBTC, mETH, mDOT, and mGLXY pools, totaling more than $2M in withdrawals. In yet another blow to Terra, Korean media alleged that Terra’s executives formed the company Kernel Labs, a purported technology incubator, to avoid taxes in the country. Local media claimed that many Terra developers were hired by Kernel, noting the country’s tax authorities flagged a $4.8M transfer from Terraform Labs to Kernel Labs’ CEO last year.']"

['BTC Tracks Nasdaq as Crypto Faces Its First Recession'],"['Bitcoin has been over 90% correlated with the Nasdaq since Apr. 8. By: Owen Fernau Crypto market cap is down 57.7% from its Nov. 8 highs, and economists say we could be on the cusp of the first global recession since the 2008 financial crisis. That revives the undying question: is crypto tethered to the stock market? Bitcoin has maintained above a 0.9 correlation with the Nasdaq since Apr. 8, according to a dashboard by The Block. A correlation of 1 would mean that crypto and the Nasdaq are entirely in lockstep. Simply put, this means that crypto has been tracking the stock market more than 90% of the time. A graph charting both the Nasdaq and BTC from the beginning of the year suggests the correlation has been strong throughout the year. Bitcoin (blue) vs Nasdaq (orange) Crypto’s correlation with the stock market is why Richard Craib, founder of Numerai, a hedge fund that uses crypto to crowdsource economic models, on May 8 announced he was selling all the ETH he bought eight years ago in the cryptocurrency’s ICO for $0.26 per token. Craib said in a Twitter thread that he sold his ETH because crypto was correlated with both venture capital flows and the Nasdaq. Other investors, while not explicitly selling ETH or other crypto assets, are thinking along similar lines. “For [the] recent period, it [has] been all one trade — amount of liquidity,” Jordi Alexander, the CIO of Selini Capital, best known for his article that framed OlympusDAO as a Ponzi, told The Defiant. The investor said that in 2020, well before interest rates started rising, crypto (and equities) were essentially rising because there was lots of money flowing around in the market. “People don’t understand inflation at all, I’ve found,” said Alexander. “There’s the money printing phase, where peoples’ bank accounts are going up. Bitcoin does well but so do other assets.” To Alexander, that phase took place in 2020. In 2021, people realized that other people’s bank accounts are going up, too, and there’s only so much of what Alexander called “real stuff” to buy. That’s when “All the excess money goes into speculat[ive] games of greater fools,” the investor said. “Bitcoin doesn’t do great because there are wild returns on random things happening.” Confusing winners, like the ascension of Bored Apes, could be examples. Now in 2022, with two Fed rate hikes under our belt and more on the way, money doesn’t slosh around like it used to. As a consequence, traders aren’t buying dips, said Alexander, explaining why the price of Bitcoin has fallen 29.6% without remorse since the Fed’s first rate hike on Mar. 16. Alexander predicted the crash in December. On the crypto podcast UpOnly, he said that crypto would crash sometime around March or April, once rates went up and money printing slowed down. “The liquidity just won’t actually be there, people will realize it’s not there,” Alexander said in December of the then-hypothetical (and now very real) crash. The investor predicted that BTC’s correlation with equities will fall in the second half of the year, when stocks meander sideways and inflation persists.“BTC is basically designed exactly for this stagflationary environment,” the investor said. Indeed, BTC with its cap of 21M tokens, is all but guaranteed to become more scarce relative to fiat currencies. “The demand for a hard money asset only exists when growth is low, liquidity is capped, and purchasing power is a struggle to maintain,” Alexander said. According to him, that time has yet to come. While “it’s all one trade” might hold true for now, Bitcoin may soon shine brightly once again. At the very least, that’s some hopium for embattled crypto hodlers.']"

Dubbed MXN₮, the stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the Peso, according to Tether, meaning each MXN₮ token is worth one Peso. It debuted on the Ethereum, Tron and Polygon blockchains. “We have seen a rise in cryptocurrency usage in Latin America over the last year that has made it apparent that we need to expand our offerings,”Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief technology officer, said in a prepared statement.“MXN₮ can minimize volatility for those looking to convert their assets and investments from fiat to digital currencies.” In announcing the move, Tether pointed to data showing 40% of Mexican companies would like to “adopt blockchain and cryptocurrencies in some form.” Additionally, the “multibillion-dollar flow of remittances into Mexico and the difficulties involved with money transfers, have created a unique opportunity for stablecoin usage and adoption.” Major fiat-backed stablecoins like USDT, USDC and BUSD are widely used. Tether’s USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, with $72.6 billion in circulation as of Thursday morning. USD Coin, was the second-largest, with almost $53 billion in circulation. They have, despite concerns over their backing, generally retained stable pegs. But other, so-called algorithmic stablecoins have proven less reliable than advertised in recent weeks, attracting government scrutiny. The UST stablecoin, whose peg was guaranteed by a complex self-executing algorithm, rather than actual cash reserves, lost its peg and collapsed in dramatic fashion earlier this month. USDT also briefly lost its peg during the crash, dropping from $1 to $0.95 on May 12. Unlike UST, USDT is backed by a combination of commercial paper and U.S. Treasury bills, Tether claims. Tether has faced questions about the veracity of those claims. In 2019, the New York Attorney General’s office alleged Tether misrepresented the degree to which USDT was backed by fiat collateral. The NYAG settled with Tether, ending the investigation. Last week, Tether reported having decreased its commercial paper holdings in a move meant to highlight “that Tether is fully backed and that the composition of its reserves is strong, conservative, and liquid,” in the words of Ardoino. Many regulators still treat stablecoins with caution. “[Stablecoins] run risks which could threaten financial stability,” U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen testified in a Senate Banking Committee hearing on May 10, adding that it was “urgent” for Congress to pass new legislation regulating them. In addition to USD₮ and MXN₮, Tether offers Euro-pegged and offshore Yuan-pegged stablecoins called EUR₮ and CNH₮, respectively.']"

At a total value-locked (TVL) of $8.57B, Aave is the third-largest DeFi protocol and the largest decentralized money market. Aave had incentivized adoption on its v2 deployment since April 2021 by offering AAVE tokens to those that borrowed or supplied crypto. The rewards also let depositors continuously post borrowed assets as collateral, offsetting borrowing costs with the extra AAVE they earned. But on May 22, the protocol’s rewards program expired on v2. Users can still earn incentives on Aave’s v3 deployments on Avalanche and Harmony in the form of those platforms’ network tokens, AVAX and ONE. Harmony only rewards users that supply its native ONE token, Avalanche offers AVAX to those that supply seven out of the nine assets listed on the protocol, and to those that borrow stablecoins. Aave has shown no interest in launching a new rewards program for v2. For now, Aave’s main rival, Ethereum-based money market Compound, continues to offer COMP rewards to its users. But Compound’s community is divided on whether to continue distributing incentives. In March, the Compound community voted to slash rewards by 50% to prevent opportunistic yield farmers from harvesting all the rewards. The proposal’s author, Tyler Loewen, emphasized that “an overwhelming amount of the COMP rewards are being farmed and instantly sold off.” Compound’s community blames the inflationary incentive scheme for COMP’s poor price performance. The token has crashed 93.2% from its peak of $910 last May. AAVE is also down 85% since its May 2021 high of $662. In April, Loewen proposed abandoning rewards entirely for the time being as part of a four-phase plan to redesign the interest rates offered by its pools and incentive program. He suggested that COMP should only be distributed to kickstart new markets launched on the platform for the first three months after they go live. The proposal to completely scrap rewards was narrowly voted down by the Compound community, receiving nearly 500,000 votes against the proposal compared to 492,678 in favor. Critics argued that the removal of rewards would significantly weaken Compound’s competitiveness and drive capital toward its competitors. Aave is currently the fourth-largest protocol on Ethereum with a TVL of $7.64B, while Compound ranks seventh with $4.08B.']"

['Is It Different This Time? Analysts Explain This Year’s Crypto Crash'],"['Analysis of the 2022 crypto bear market in the context of previous cycles. By: Owen Fernau The most popular tokens of 2021 – Layer 1s, GameFi, meme tokens, and DeFi 2.0 – are all down over 75% from their all-time highs. While the market braces for a crypto winter, one question swirls around traders’ minds: How low can it go? Those who endured the harsh crypto winter of late 2018 and early 2019 might remember that BTC dropped 83% the following its 2017 high of $19,665, and ETH dropped 94% to $83 about 11 months after its former peak of $1,448. Right now, around six months after BTC and ETH’s all-time highs, the two largest cryptocurrencies are down 56% and 59%, respectively. If this cycle copies the last, BTC would sink from highs of $68,789 to $12,000 and ETH would fall from $4878 to below $300. Of course, no two cycles are the same. “This is uncharted territory. Since crypto started, we’ve been in a decade-long bull run with low to zero interest rates,” DeFi analyst The DeFi Edge told The Defiant. “We’re facing inflation rates at a 40 year high. Crypto needs more money to grow and it’s a horrible environment now.” Indeed, the Federal Reserve has raised rates twice this year to target between 0.75% and 1% – up from near 0% amid the pandemic – flushing money from crypto into more stable assets, such as treasury bonds. The Fed raised interest rates from 2016 through 2019, meaning the 2017 boom occurred in a similar situation. But crypto prices bottomed out in mid-2019 when interest rates hit a high for the decade. Ryan Watkins, a former Messari analyst who launched a crypto hedge fund this month, sees the current environment as unprecedented. “We are at the mercy of a broader macroeconomic slowdown which is hurting risk assets across the board,” the hedge fund manager said. “This is something crypto has never been through.” 20 year Federal Funds Rate The crypto market’s different this time around, too. The collapse of the Terra stablecoin network took $25 billion from DeFi, and within two weeks of its crash, the market has shed nearly $700B in value. Watkins believes crypto has made real progress in the last four years. “Although [the] industry is still immature and most projects are garbage, this time around there are some projects that have product market fit,” he said. The hedge fund manager added that despite differences in the macro environment and increased user traction, the current crypto downturn is more similar to the last than it is different. And a crypto winter might not be all bad: investors have a lot more distractions. “There was literally nothing to do during the 2018 bear market,” said The DeFi Edge. “DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs didn’t exist yet. So many people lost interest because of how boring it was. Now we have billions in value locked up and more talented builders than ever before.” A report by Electric Capital published in January measured web3 development activity at an all-time high – but, with monthly peaks of 18,416 active developers, still small. Electric Capital found that developers stuck around during the last bear market, with the bull attracting more. Longtime holders with sizable crypto portfolios can only hope developers hold on through this bear market, too. Those new to the cold may be shivering.']"

['Frax Founder Pins $25B Stablecoin Supply Drop on Fed Rate Hikes'],"[""The market capitalization of dollar-pegged stablecoins has dropped by $25B in the wake of Terra's collapse. By: Owen Fernau When TerraUSD (UST) fell from $1 to $0.09 last week, a huge sell-off shrank the dollar-pegged stablecoin market by 14.1% in a week. Now down $25.34B, the market cap for stablecoins sits at $154.53B, according to The Block. UST, which all but collapsed after its sister token, LUNA, spiralled into oblivion, was responsible for $18.64B of the drop. Tether (USDT), which briefly fell to as low as $0.95, contributed losses of about $7 billion. While uncertainty about Tether’s reserves and a loss in confidence in Terra’s algorithmic peg could explain some of the losses, even stablecoins that held firm suffered major drops. DAI’s market cap dropped 18.0%, from $7.87B to $6.45B, and FRAX dropped 43.9%, from $2.64B to $1.48B. The market cap for Abracadabra’s Magic Internet Money (MIM) also lost about $1B. So why the sudden washout in stablecoins? Sam Kazemian, the founder of Frax Finance, the issuer of the FRAX partially-collateralized stablecoin, said the seeds were planted long before the collapse of UST– things started when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% in March. “The real reason this is happening is more of a dollar liquidity crisis and dollar purchasing power rising against all assets,” he told The Defiant. “When Fed rates rise, liquidity…gets sucked out [of everything and put] into US treasuries as the risk-free rate rises,” he said. US treasuries bonds – debt you can buy from the US government – are historically low-risk assets that offer near-guaranteed yields. In May, the Fed raised interest rates again, this time by 0.5%. Rising interest rates meant traders could earn a higher income from treasury bonds. When interest rates rise, treasury bonds become more attractive than volatile cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and DeFi protocols that offer highly variable yields. So when cryptocurrency prices fell against the dollar, stablecoins became less important for DeFi. When DeFi trading volumes fall, traders don’t need as many dollar-pegged assets to balance liquidity pools in automated market makers (AMMs), like Uniswap or Curve. And when digital assets fall against the dollar, traders can’t afford to borrow as many U.S. dollar stablecoins. “Basically you can do much less with the same number of ETH tokens in dollar [terms] so [fewer] dollars/stablecoins [are] needed on-chain,” Kazemian said. “And most of those stablecoins are being redeemed/sucked out of the space into US treasuries.” He said that the problem isn’t exclusive to crypto – Hong Kong’s central bank, deployed $722M last week to maintain its currency’s peg to the dollar. “Keeping the dollar peg is about the most difficult thing you can do right now,” Kazemian said. “No one wants dollar-pegged things, they want straight-up dollars themselves to go buy treasuries.”""]"

Crypto’s market capitalization fell from $1.81T on May 5 to lows of $1.12T on May 12. The market started to rise on Friday, and now rests at $1.28T, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The crash was exacerbated by the collapse of Terra, the stablecoin protocol that fell into a death spiral after traders lost confidence in the volatile token that propped up the network, LUNA. The six largest tokens by market capitalization rebounded slightly Friday after bottoming out the day before and have held steady since, according to data from Coin Gecko. The same goes for DeFi, where the combined total value locked (TVL) has stabilized after plunging 45% last week. On May 5, traders had locked $205 billion in DeFi protocols, according to DeFi Llama. On Friday, DeFi’s combined TVL had fallen to $111 billion and has not budged much since. Ethereum, which accounts for the vast majority of DeFi’s TVL, dropped to $71.3 billion Friday, its lowest figure since June 2021. As of Wednesday, TVL in Ethereum was just under $71.2 billion. The price of Ether (ETH), meanwhile, fell from just over $2,900 on May 5 to $1,824 a week later, according to CoinGecko. A day later, it had recovered to $2,000, where it has hovered since. The same goes for other leading cryptocurrencies.\xa0Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, dropped from highs of close to $40,000 on May 5 to lows of not-quite $27,000 on May 12, before resting at just under $30,000.

['Algorithmic Stablecoin Landscape Suffers Tremors After Terra Crash'],"['Terra’s UST collapse has shattered the foundations of the algorithmic stablecoin market. By: Jason Levin Terra’s UST collapse has shattered the foundations of the algorithmic stablecoin market. After the collapse of Terra, algorithmic stablecoins have been experiencing jitters across the market – a sign that investors are losing confidence that this model of creating stable cryptocurrency can be sustainable in the long term. Vai (VAI) fell from its peg down to as low as $0.87 on May 10, Fei USD (FEI) dropped to $0.97 on May 11, and Neutrino USD (USDN) fell to $0.70 on the morning of May 12. While FEI is now hovering around its peg, VAI and USDN are now sitting at $0.93 and $0.95 respectively. Algorithmic stablecoins are managed by a set of operations encoded in smart contracts to keep the currency as close to their peg as possible. The target peg is typically set at $1 dollar. While issuance, collateralization and rewards vary from project to project, at their core, algorithmic stablecoins rely on mint and burn mechanisms to control their supply without the need of a centralized entity. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST made headlines after it de-pegged this week, its blockchain was halted, resumed, and now sits at $0.15, while LUNA, the volatile asset backing UST, has been inflated away to fractions of a penny. The purpose of UST was to create a decentralized stablecoin that offered a high yield to its users and an alternative to asset-backed stablecoins like MakerDAO’s DAI. But, billions of dollars of value were wiped out. UST wasn’t the first algorithmic stablecoin to implode. It turns out that Terra’s founder Do Kwon was allegedly the pseudonymous founder of Basis Cash, a completely different failed stablecoin, as reported by CoinDesk. Basis Cash was a fork of Basis, a VC-backed stablecoin project that also failed due to regulatory concerns. On top of the billions lost in value, there is growing concern over regulations to be handed down from Washington. But, there is a big difference between algorithmic stablecoins and asset-backed stablecoins. On the flip side from algorithmic stablecoins, asset-backed stablecoins are backed by assets such as fiat currency, bonds, or even other cryptocurrencies. Some of the largest asset-backed stablecoins are DAI, Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). “UST was in a category of its own, relying solely on its algorithmic mechanism, a risky model that many predicted might fail”, tweeted Jake Chervinsky, Head of Policy at the Blockchain Association. “That’s far different from the many collateralized stablecoins, custodial & decentralized, which all performed well during this week’s high volatility.” As Chervinksy alluded to, despite algorithmic stablecoins’ shakiness, asset-backed stablecoins have remained steady for the most part. Over the last seven days, USDC hasn’t fluctuated more than a thousandth of a penny while Binance USD and MakerDAO’s DAI haven’t moved more than a hundredth of a penny. USDT did lose its peg for a moment and fell to $0.95, but quickly shot back up to $1.00. Is it the end of algorithmic stablecoins? Messari analyst Dustin Teander told The Defiant that it depends on the definition. If you classify algo stables with zero or less than 20% of collateral, then it’s a resounding “yes”. He clarifies that he thinks models like Frax – which have high collateral factors – are here for good.']"

['Trader May Have Lost $9M in Exit from USDT'],"['Data Indicates Bots Made Off With Huge Sum on Arbitrum By: Samuel Haig Opportunistic bots may have made off with millions of dollars worth of profits after one trader hastily tried to exit an enormous USDT position. On May 12, Twitter user gzeon flagged\xa0that one USDT holder on the Arbitrum network appeared to have incurred a $9.4M loss after hastily trying to convert $15.5M USDT for USDC via Curve’s deployment on the Arbitrum blockchain. Curve is a decentralized exchange designed to facilitate efficient stablecoin trading. Transaction data from Arbiscan shows that the user sold 15.5M USDT and received just 6.14M USDC in exchange. Analyzing the data, Gzeon estimates that MEV bots made off with $3M from the transaction. Curve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. MEV refers to Miner Extractable Value, which describes the practice of miners or other network validators manipulating the order of transactions in a network’s blockchain to extract profits. MEV researchers Flashbots estimate that $8.3M was extracted from transactions on the Ethereum mainnet in the past 24 hours. More than $623M has been extracted through MEV from Ethereum to-date. Terra Stops and Starts to Salvage Network. The trade punctuated a week rocked by the failure of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST. The leading centralized stablecoin, Tether (USDT), briefly lost its peg yesterday, sparking panic among holders. The crisis has cast a spotlight on stablecoins, which have been far more volatile in the last seven days than Bitcoin or Ether, or even joke tokens like Dogecoin. In the last two days, Terra Network has been shut down twice after its flagship LUNA erased $40B in market value and UST, the ecosystem’s stablecoin, slipped its peg and crashed. Now fears are mounting that Tether, the sector’s largest stablecoin and one long been criticized for its opaque reserves, could also lose its peg. Traders looking to offload Tether resulted in USDT’s price dropping to $0.97 on the centralized exchange Coinbase, with data from CoinMarketCap suggesting USDT slipped as low as $0.95. Curve Finance’s 3pool, which is comprised of USDT, DAI, and USDC, was briefly 80% composed of Tether as traders rushed to offload the stablecoin. USDT has since regained its peg, with the company’s CTO assuring that Tether redemptions are operating as usual. Neutrino USD (USDN), the native stablecoin of the Waves network, has also tumbled amid the market turmoil. In early April, USDN lost its peg and crashed down to $0.60 amid speculation that the growth of both it and the WAVES token were being fueled by borrowed USDC. While the stablecoin quickly rebounded, USDN failed to fully regain its peg and trended between $0.97 and $0.99 until yesterday. According to CoinGecko, USDN slumped down to $0.76 yesterday and last changed hands for $0.89, suggesting traders are uneasy about holding the token. USDN/USD.

"[""Do Kwon Humbled as LUNA Spirals and UST Suffers 'Lehman Moment'""]","[""Terra Struggling to Stabilize Crisis as Investors Flee By: Jason Levin “I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you,” Do Kwon tweeted Wednesday morning. “Extremely tough” will be an understatement for users who trusted their savings on a stablecoin – emphasis on the word “stable” – to now own only a small fraction of their initial holdings. Rarely has such a high-flying crypto project fallen so far, so fast, even in this volatile asset class. Investors woke Wednesday morning to see that Terra’s native token, LUNA, is trading at $1.55. That’s down 97.5% from its all-time high of $119.18. Moreover, UST, Terra’s flagship stablecoin, which slipped its peg on Monday, has continued its slide after briefly rebounding Tuesday, to touch as low as $0.29 in early trading New York time on Wednesday. LUNA, which stormed out of nowhere last year to notch a $41B market value and foment an entire crypto ecosystem, is now worth $1.8B, according to CoinMarketCap. Even worse, Terra’s meltdown may have repercussions outside of its ecosystem, impacting the entire blockchain industry. UST’s faceplant has triggered a regulatory crackdown in Washington, and delivered a heavy blow to the credibility of algorithmic stablecoins. While Do Kwon and his team are scrambling to shore up their stricken tokens, investors are bailing en masse. It’s hard to see how Terra and its system can recover. Not that Kwon and his team are waving the white flag. For the last three days, they have been scrambling like mad to stabilize their wayward stablecoin and rekindle confidence in LUNA and UST. First off, they sold $750M in Bitcoin reserves to defend UST’s peg. Alas, it didn’t work for long. At the same time, the Luna Foundation Guard, a Singapore-based non-profit that supports Terra, loaned Terra $1.5B in Bitcoin on Monday to stop the bleeding. That didn’t work either. Now the foundation is turning to top crypto investors to raise $1B to backstop UST, according to a report in The Block. Then early Wednesday morning, Kwon endorsed a Terra community proposal to increase LUNA’s basepool to 100M special drawing rights from 50M, a move that will increase minting capacity from $293M to $1.2B, he said. That’s designed to help shore up UST. Crypto wags quickly dubbed the bailout “Kwontitaive easing”, a riff on how central banks print money and flood economies with stimulus during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. “I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this. Together,” Kwon vowed in a tweet. The fall of Terra is making an immediate impact on a market that was already reeling from rising interest rates, inflation, and Russia’s war on Ukraine. An index of the top 100 DeFi coins has lost a third of its value in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko. The episode is also punctuating the sense that crypto, after a spectacular two-year bull run that saw it peak at $3T last November, is truly entering a bear market. As one of the high-flying stars of decentralized finance, Terra’s crisis is casting a pall across a sector that’s been lauded for its innovative energy and received billions of dollars in capital investment in just the last year. “My question now is where will contagion show up from the UST meltdown?,” asked Will Clemente, an analyst at Bitcoin hardware company Blockware Solutions. “This is crypto’s Bear Sterns/Lehman Brother’s moment, but here there are no [government] bailouts.” It’s also quite the reckoning for Kwon, a South Korean native who studied computer science at Stanford University and co-founded Terraform Labs in 2018 in Singapore. A dynamic and outspoken entrepreneur, Kwon quickly established himself as one of the most ambitious builders in DeFi. Do Kwon founded Terra in 2018. Not content with one platform, he assembled a constellation of interlocking projects such as LUNA, Terra’s native token, the Luna Foundation, and Anchor, a savings and lending platform that offered 20% fixed interest to investors. And of course there was UST, a stablecoin that was backed by an algorithmic formula to control supply and demand, rather than fiat currency such as U.S. dollars. By pledging to redeem 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA, the stablecoin was supposed to be more censorship resistant than counterparts such as USDC, which rely on holding U.S. dollars in a bank. It was just the type of edgy innovation that crypto investors loved. As Terra’s value multiplied by tens of billions of dollars in 2021, Kwon developed a taste for braggadocio. He dubbed himself the “Master of Stablecoin.” He was so confident in his handiwork that in March he accepted a $10M bet that Luna would be higher in 12 months. Terra's founder and a leading critic are squaring off with a $1M bet on LUNA. In April, Kwon vowed to poleax DAI, the algorithmic stablecoin supported by DeFi stalwart MakerDAO. He introduced a “4pool,” an amalgam of four stablecoins on Curve Finance to take on his rival. “By my hand $DAI will die,” Kwon tweeted. Even as Kwon was struggling to save his own projects from an untimely demise, MakerDAO inked a groundbreaking deal this week to use DAI to finance a shipment of Australian beef to Hong Kong. It’s the kind of project that demonstrates the real world utility of DeFi. Do Kwon has not responded for comment in time of publication. Now Kwon is setting out to rescue with the humility and industry of a man who is watching his dream, and billions of dollars in value, evaporate. He has communicated clearly with the Terra community on Twitter, as has the Terra Daily feed. Kwon has walked followers through the process of stablecoin pegs. “Before anything else, the only path forward is to absorb the stablecoin supply that wants to exit before $UST can repeg,” he said. And he and Terra Daily are inviting members to join forums and volunteer ideas for stabilizing the crisis. Kwon urged his followers to accept that Terra is built for the long term. “Short term stumbles do not define what you can accomplish,” he said. The problem is that Terra’s collapse has all the hallmarks of something far more devastating than a stumble. At this point, as the effort to salvage the project continues, there may be only one certainty. “This is a painful lesson for a lot of new market entrants for sure,” said Adam Cochrane, a partner at Cinneamhaine Ventures.""]"

['Coinbase Will Keep Customer Balances in Event of Bankruptcy'],"['Bearish Market Takes Toll on Financials in First Quarter By: Samuel Haig Coinbase will take your coins if it goes bankrupt. That was the rather jarring message in the first quarter earnings release for the leading U.S.-based centralized exchange. It says customers balances\xa0will be considered Coinbase’s property in the event it files for administration. The disclosure highlights the custodial risks of holding crypto assets on the exchange. “Because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings… and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors,” Coinbase said in the May 10 filing. In traditional finance, unsecured creditors such as bond holders are typically out of luck if a company declares bankruptcy. So, too, are stockholders. Essentially, Coinbase is informing customers that they shouldn’t expect to get all or even some of their money back if the concern goes belly up. That didn’t sit well with many in the crypto community. Many responded to Coinbase’s updated terms by reciting the popular mantra “not your keys, not your coins,” and advocated that users hold their assets in non-custodial wallets. In the three months ending March 31, Coinbase lost $430M on $1.2B in net revenue. Investors had expected $1.4B in revenue for the quarter, according to Refinitiv. Coinbase’s shares tumbled 16% on Tuesday, according to data from Morningstar. Coinbase’s lack of profitability is partly due to capital investments it’s making to build out the platform. Operating expenses for the quarter were $1.7B, exceeding its revenue for the first time since Coinbase began reporting its financials. On the revenue side of the ledger, quarterly retail trade volume sank 43.5% to $309B. The number of active monthly retail users on Coinbase also dropped more than 19%. Despite the decline in trade activity, Coinbase reported a gain in market share by volume for seven of the top 10 crypto assets by market cap. Coinbase’s share price.

"[""Terra's Stablecoin Structure Unravels on a Wild Day""]","[""LUNA's Collapse May Consign UST to Long List of Failed Algo Stablecoins By: Samuel Haig The vulnerability in UST was plain to see from the outset. It was staring the market in the face. The stablecoin’s promise to redeem 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA invited trouble. It was a trade that required a leap of faith in LUNA’s resilience rather than the unambiguous support of hard reserves such as the dollar. And on May 9, that imbalance walloped investors when Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin tumbled 40% to $0.61. While on Tuesday UST rebounded to about $0.90, the episode has delivered a blow to UST’s credibility, and perhaps that of algorithmic stablecoins in general. The drama punctuated a day that seemed to finally dispel any hope that investors could dodge a punishing bear market. What happens next with Terra, a DeFi darling for the last nine months, will be an important bellwether as in a market that’s lost confidence and is sown with panic. UST’s slide was triggered when Terra’s native LUNA token cratered and could no longer support its sister token. The troubles also followed $500M worth of UST positions being sold via the Terra-based Anchor protocol on March 7, which appeared to shake confidence in LUNA and its broader ecosystem. Terra previously promised that users could swap 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA and vice-versa as a mechanism intended to maintain its peg. The design was supposed to iron out UST price volatility by incentivizing arbitrageurs to step in and trade the token should it move above or below the $1 level. While the price of UST has bounced back 50% from the lows on the back of $2.4B in volume on Binance alone, questions remain as to the viability of UST’s design, and whether it may be destined to rest in the graveyard of failed stablecoin projects. UST/USD. Source: CoinGecko. The Basis stablecoin, previously known as Basecoin, was among the first algorithmic stablecoin experiments in crypto. The project began in August 2017 with a $133M funding round in April 2018 from leading venture capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, and Lightspeed Ventures. Basis planned to issue bond and share tokens that would be used to expand and contract the token’s supply and maintain its peg by incentivizing arbitrageurs to purchase or burn BAC depending on whether the stablecoin would be trading above or below $1. But regulators stepped in and said the bond tokens were securities and demanded that the project collect detailed know-your-customer information and issue tokens solely to accredited investors. “Unfortunately, having to apply US securities regulation to the system had a serious negative impact on our ability to launch Basis,” a notice on the Basis website states. “Although this isn’t the outcome any of us wanted, we knew going into this that we were fundamentally making a binary bet on a favorable regulatory landscape.” Basis returned the capital it raised to investors, and did not launch the protocol. Launched in 2020, Empty Set Dollar described itself as an algorithmic stablecoin that would act as the reserve currency for the DeFi sector. It sought to build on the design planned for Basis, and was launched by an anonymous team to minimize the threat posed by regulatory intervention. The protocol sought to maintain its peg by issuing additional tokens when its price rose above $1 to increase supply and dilute the value of already circulating tokens. By contrast, it would incentivize users to burn their tokens in exchange for debt coupons when the price fell below $1 to create scarcity. Although the price of ESD hovered near $1 during much of the fourth quarter of 2020, the token went into a death cycle in late December that year. ESD has consistently trended downwards since, last changing hands for just $0.005. It represents a 24-hour trading volume of just $26,310. ESD/USD price. Source: CoinGecko. In November 2020, the seeming success of ESD inspired two anonymous developers operating under the pseudonyms ‘Rick’ and ‘Morty’ to launch their own homage to Basis. The pair launched Basis Cash that month, distributing BAC tokens to users that locked up other popular stablecoins including DAI, USDC, and SUSD. The project issued bonds and share tokens to control supply and incentivize the destruction of tokens when needed. But Basis Cash only traded near $1 for roughly two weeks, with the token steadily crashing more than 90% during the first six months of 2021. The token was last exchanged for $0.008, with BAC driving just $33,645 in volume over the past day. BAC/USD. Source: CoinGecko. Ampleforth is another algorithmic stablecoin that took inspiration from Basis. Its peg is maintained by daily rebase events that adjust the supply of users’ balances in a bid to maintain its price at $1. The protocol launched in mid-2019 and quickly appeared destined for failure when the price of AMPL steadily sank to levels below $0.40 just three months later. But its price recovered, with AMPL trading close to $1 from November 2019 until mid-February 2020. AMPL experienced wild volatility in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 and since then it has continued to post dramatic swings between the roughly $2 and $0.70 range, seemingly undermining its utility as a stablecoin.

But the protocol quickly became the subject of controversy, with a pseudonymous Twitter account alleging that the Neutrino team were pumping the value of WAVES and using the Vires money market protocol to prop up USDN’s market cap in early April. A subsequent crash in the price of WAVES was accompanied by USDN quickly losing its peg. The token traded as low as $0.60 early last month, before largely recovering.

['LUNA Loses Half its Value in 24 Hours as DeFi Tokens Crater'],"['Avalanche Also Plunges as Bears Chomp on Crypto By: Samuel Haig DeFi assets are taking a beating. The combined capitalization of DeFi tokens has fallen below $100B for the first time since last August as cryptocurrencies crater. Terra’s LUNA token has been the hardest hit. After rallying to all-time highs of $115 just five weeks ago, LUNA is currently changing hands for just $33, a 71% plunge, according to data from CoinGecko. The long-anticipated depegging of Terra’s leading stablecoin, UST, accelerated LUNA’s losses yesterday. The LUNA/UST trade. Source: CoinGecko. UST fell as much as 40% against the dollar as UST hodlers capitulated in response to LUNA’s capitalization dipping below that of UST. The stablecoin previously sought to maintain its peg by allowing holders to sell or purchase $1 worth of LUNA in exchange for 1 UST, incentivizing arbitrageurs to step in and stabilize price action. But with users unable to redeem the token for $1 worth LUNA amid the depegging, UST’s price quickly dived. Terra’s top dApp, Anchor Protocol, has suffered even heavier losses and ranks as the biggest loser among the DeFi sector’s top 100 assets. ANC crashed 47% in the last 24 hours to last change hands for $0.82. Mirror, another leading Terra-based protocol, is also down 24% over the past day.

By: yyctrader Terra’s stablecoin UST, the poster child for decentralized assets tied to the US dollar, rebounded sharply on Tuesday as it climbed as high as $0.92 after plunging 40% below its dollar peg, to $0.60, on Monday. The blockchain’s native LUNA remains in free-fall, having lost half its value in the last 24 hours as of mid-morning trading London time. Luna price. Source: CoinMarketCap UST has been the most successful example of an algorithmic stablecoin, or a stable asset which depends on an internal algorithm that manages its supply and demand to maintain its peg. Developers have tried to create these self-regulating assets for years, with many crashing and burning along the way. In Terra’s case, 1 UST can always be redeemed for $1 worth of LUNA. This mechanism incentivizes arbitrageurs to buy UST when it trades under $1, redeem it for $1 worth of LUNA, and sell the LUNA for a profit. Conversely, when UST trades above $1, investors can mint 1 UST with $1 worth of LUNA and sell the UST for a profit. A crisis of confidence has ensnared UST as investors are exiting their holdings en masse. UST traded as low as 60 cents on the dollar on Monday with nearly $3B in trading volume on the centralized exchange Binance alone. UST price on Binance The trouble began on May 7 when a few large investors sold more than $500M in UST positions on Anchor, the popular savings protocol that serves as the largest supply sink for UST. Deposits on Anchor have fallen by half since Friday from $14B to $7B. Anchor Deposits and Loans  At the time, Terra brushed off concerns, but the market wasn’t so sure as LUNA, the token backing UST, started to deepen its slide.  The steady depletion of liquidity from the UST Curve pool as users swapped UST for other stablecoins can be seen in this Dune dashboard. 3crv liquidity in the UST Curve pool Earlier today, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) deployed $1.5B of its reserves in an attempt to defend the UST peg. According to the project, $750M worth of Bitcoin and $750M have been loaned to market makers to support peg restoration efforts. Despite these moves, investors began to panic after the market capitalization of LUNA fell below that of UST just after 1pm Eastern time, meaning there is simply not enough value in LUNA to back all the UST in circulation, not considering the recently constructed LFG reserve. What does that mean? If the circulating UST is worth more than the market cap of LUNA, it’s not possible for all UST holders to redeem their tokens for $1 worth of LUNA if they wish to. The resulting stampede for the exits is the dreaded ‘bank run’ scenario that has laid waste to numerous algorithmic stablecoins including the infamous implosion of Iron Finance last year. The last time this happened was in May 2021, and UST briefly de-pegged before recovering. On a bloody day in crypto markets, Terra also came under fire for allegedly selling Bitcoin and Ether and compounding a bad situation. “UST was always a systematic risk for crypto. If the peg is not restored through natural demand LFG needs to tap into their reserves to prop it up themselves by selling BTC and buying UST,” crypto trader Cantering Clark told The Defiant. The carnage also resulted in a string of liquidations on Abracadabra’s Degenbox, which allows investors to leverage the yield offered by Anchor.

"[""Waves' USDN Stablecoin Loses Peg as Accusations of Ponzi Schemes Fly""]","[""Waves' high flying token and stablecoin have crashed after peaking on March 31. By: yyctrader Waves, a Layer 1 blockchain known as ‘Russia’s Ethereum’, has suffered a reversal of fortune as accusations of Ponzi schemes and market manipulation fly in a wild week of action. Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of crypto exchange FTX, got swept into the drama as one of Russia’s major crypto plays went sideways. The project’s native token WAVES began to surge a few days after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. This led to speculation that Russians were using the platform to circumvent Western sanctions after several of the nation’s banks were cut off from the Swift messaging system. WAVES soared 600% in a month to an all-time high of $62 on March 31.  Waves price moves this year. Source: CoinMarketCap During the same period, the market capitalization of Neutrino USD, Waves’ native stablecoin, nearly doubled to $900M. Neutrino USD chart. Source: CoinMarketCap On Apr. 4, WAVES lost more than a quarter of its value, dropping to a low of $33.27, down almost 50% from its March 31 high. This coincided with Neutrino USD losing its dollar peg as it briefly traded below $0.60 before rebounding. It was trading at $0.82 in the early morning UK time Tuesday. Neutrino USD, or USDN, is an algorithmic stablecoin that is collateralized by WAVES tokens. In a way, it operates in a similar fashion to UST and LUNA, as USDN can be minted with and redeemed for WAVES.  USDN has a native staking yield that serves as its main source of demand and is the primary usecase on the Waves blockchain. Crucially, the staking yield is dependent on the price of WAVES, which determines a multiplier. So, staking rewards increase as the WAVES market cap trends higher, stoking more demand for USDN. On March 31, 0xHamz, a crypto investor with 16,000 followers on Twitter, published a thread calling out Waves as “the biggest Ponzi in crypto.” They accused the Waves team of artificially engineering price spikes by buying WAVES tokens with funds borrowed on Vires Finance, the dominant lending protocol on Waves.  Such a scheme requires a steady supply of USDC and USDT available to be borrowed, which Vires was able to attract by offering above-market yields to lenders. In the wake of these allegations, users began to withdraw their stablecoins from Vires, causing borrowing rates to spike to 80% APR and making it unfeasible to borrow. USDN began to gradually depeg as users sought to exit by swapping into other stablecoins using Curve’s USDN pool. Curve’s stableswap invariant is limiting the damage yet again as USDN continues to trade around 80 cents despite making up nearly 93% of pool assets. Waves founder Sasha Ivanov countered on Apr. 3 by launching a broadside against crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. “Get your popcorn ready: Alameda Research manipulates $waves price,” Ivanov tweeted. Ivanov alleged that Alameda took a short position in WAVES and organized a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) campaign to manipulate the token price in its favour. Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried fired back and called the tweet an “obv[ious] bullshit conspiracy theory” and CEO Sam Trabucco pointed to the funding rates for WAVES, hinting at the firm’s possible strategy. With a lot of traders shorting WAVES on FTX, funding rates had dropped deeply into negative territory, meaning that traders were incentivized to open long positions. Had Alameda done so to capture the funding fees, they would naturally have hedged the position against adverse price movements by shorting WAVES on-chain. A governance proposal has been introduced in the Vires forum, seeking to reduce the liquidation threshold for Waves and USDN borrowers to 0.1% and also limit borrowing rates to a maximum of 40%. If passed, existing borrowers including the alleged Alameda wallet would be forced to close their positions or risk immediate liquidation. The majority of forum users seem to be against the proposal, on which voting begins today and runs for five days. According to Twitter user lightcrypto, the wallet that drove the price up over the past month has been liquidating its WAVES tokens. While the fallout from a potential USDN collapse is unlikely to greatly affect DeFi as a whole, some users like Jack Niewold are raising questions about what could happen if Terra’s UST was to face a similar situation, given its increasing integration across DeFi. The whole episode serves as a reminder that all stablecoins are not created equal.

"[""Do Kwon's Treasury Play Allies LUNA and BTC Maxis in a Pumped Market""]","[""A $10B Bitcoin Treasury Has All the Hallmarks of a Game Changer By: Owen Fernau Earlier this month, Terra ecosystem co-founder Do Kwon bet $11M that its token, LUNA, would be higher a year from its March 14 price of $88. With LUNA hitting an all-time-high of $109 on March 29, according to CoinGecko, it looks like Kwon is well on his way to winning the bet. LUNA’s 30-day chart. Source: CoinGecko The token’s ascent comes at a time when the Terra ecosystem co-founder has made a splash in deFi with his commitment to acquire $10B of BTC to serve as a reserve currency for UST, Terra’s flagship stablecoin. At a high level, users will be able to redeem their UST for roughly an equivalent amount of BTC, though the details of the system appear to be still up in the air — Terra tweeted a proposal by Jump Crypto, outlined specifics of how the BTC reserves could be used on Mar. 22. The upward price action of LUNA, combined with the use of BTC to backstop UST, which was announced last month, has caught the attention of some of crypto’s biggest names. “We’re seeing some of the earliest and most ambitious ideas in crypto starting to unfold,” tweeted Su Zhu, who co-founded Three Arrows Capital, one of web3’s most prominent investment firms. “Crosschain decentralized stablecoin backed entirely by digitally native assets was the holy grail in 2016,” Zhu added in his tweet, tagging both BTC and LUNA, making it clear that he was referring to the new dynamic between the tokens. Three Arrows Capital, along with Jump Crypto, was one of the investment firms which bought LUNA from the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a Singapore-based nonprofit focused on supporting the Terra Ecosystem. Terra's founder and a leading critic are squaring off with a $1M bet on LUNA. The burgeoning reserve for UST creates an alliance between proponents of LUNA and BTC. Bitcoin, being the largest and one of the oldest digital assets, has plenty of “maxi” supporters who believe BTC is the only asset worth holding in the fight for a decentralized financial system. As Terra buys BTC to back UST, Bitcoin is now being used to prop up another asset’s ecosystem, one which some Bitcoin maximalists may be inclined to dismiss as a valueless distraction. But the buying support for Bitcoin is undeniable. Frank Chaparro, director of news at digital asset information company, The Block, tweeted that family offices and crypto hedge funds are buying BTC call options based on the knowledge that spot purchases for the digital asset are imminent. Tapping BTC as a backstop for UST has drawn criticism. On March 28, Eric Wall, chief investment officer at Arcane Assets, criticized the origins of the funds used to build LFG’s Bitcoin reserves on Twitter. “Don’t mean to be a party pooper but I think Terra is making a mistake to use LUNA funds that originated from the ICO to build the reserve,” Wall said. Foobazzler, as the pseudonymous angel investor is known, is skeptical of the centralized treasury’s security and says its vulnerability to an exploit makes it a moral hazard. “If the peg relies on a centrally controlled treasury, and if the owner[s] of that treasury become bad actors or compromised, the treasury can go to 0, the peg unwinds, and then the project is dead,” the investor told The Defiant. Much of the market appears unconcerned about the Terra ecosystem’s move. With a 27% gain over the last three months, LUNA is outperforming the top ten smart contract platform tokens in that time period. And it’s not close — at only 6.99%, NEAR token appreciated the second most among those leading smart contract platform tokens. LUNA leads all tokens of the top 10 smart contract platforms in the last three months. Source: TradingView Of course, there’s a long way to go until March 14, 2023, when the LUNA bet is decided. For now though, Kwon is smiling. And with BTC up 12% in the last week, you can bet the Bitcoin community is too.  ""]"

['Friday Wrap: Markets On Track For Second Week Of Gains'],"['On-chain metrics paint a short-term bullish picture. By: yyctrader Crypto markets are consolidating their gains from Thursday, buoyed by global risk-on sentiment and news that Russia may turn to Bitcoin as a payment option for gas and other commodities as Western sanctions bite. Bitcoin is trading at $44,305, up 8% in the past seven days. Ether is on track to notch up a fifth day of gains, up 11% on the week and trading at $3,150 as of 730AM ET. Total crypto market capitalization has climbed back above $2T, a level last seen in early February. Terra’s ambitious plan to accumulate $10B of Bitcoin in a reserve backing its UST stablecoin has been another tailwind for Bitcoin sentiment. Anchor protocol, the popular fixed-rate savings app on the Terra blockchain, is now DeFi’s largest lending protocol with $14B in TVL. The Luna Foundation Guard reportedly purchased 2900 BTC worth $128M earlier today. Terra founder Do Kwon called out the bears, saying their “days are numbered”. According to data from blockchain analytics provider Glassnode, the number of addresses holding at least one Bitcoin has increased steadily since the February sell-off and stands at 826,517 as of Mar. 24, a one-year high. At the same time, the percentage of Bitcoin supply held on exchanges continues to trend lower and has hit a four-year low, indicating that holders remain bullish, at least for now. Ether has outperformed Bitcoin since the Feb. 24 lows, driven by bullish sentiment around the blockchain’s long-awaited transition to Proof-of-Stake, called The Merge. Over 10.7M ETH is currently staked, an all-time high. Another 7.7M ETH is locked in DeFi, according to DefiPulse, and the percentage of Ether held on exchanges has continued to drop to levels last seen in May 2018. Noted NFT artist XCOPY released an open edition yesterday. The sale was open for ten minutes with no supply cap. Despite the relatively steep mint price of 1 ETH ($3108 at the time), 7,394 copies of the NFT were minted in the 10-minute window. Amid a cooldown in NFT interest, the sale shows that collectors continue to have an appetite for projects from established artists. ']"

['Anchor Leapfrogs Aave as Top DeFi Lending Protocol With $14B TVL'],"['Anchor is pumping despite worries about its sustainability. By: Samuel Haig Anchor, a stablecoin yield protocol representing more than 53% of Terra’s Total Value Locked (TVL), has overtaken Aave to become the third-largest dApp in DeFi. Anchor’s rise through the DeFi ranks comes as Terra has embarked upon an aggressive campaign to buy $10B worth of Bitcoin to back its native stablecoin UST. Anchor offers a fixed return of roughly 20% on UST deposits. According to DeFi Llama, Anchor now represents a TVL of roughly $14.5B after growing by 48% over just 30 days. The protocol sits behind Curve’s $20B and Lido’s $17B, with Lido also having grown by almost 59% in the past month. Anchor TVL. Source: DeFi Llama Anchor has now surpassed almost all of Ethereum’s ‘blue-chip’ DeFi assets, including the lending protocol Aave, Uniswap, and Compound. As for Terra, it now has a TVL of $27B, making it the No. 2 smart contract network, according to DeFi Llama. Terra’s aggressive Bitcoin buying spree is intended to secure UST’s peg to the U.S. dollar without destabilizing the price of its network token, LUNA. UST’s peg was previously maintained by allowing 1 UST to be purchased or sold for $1 worth of LUNA, regardless of where UST was trading in the open market. That meant that if UST dropped below $1, buying pressure from arbitrageurs seeking to purchase the stablecoin and then lock in a profit via LUNA would restore its peg, and vice versa. Many crypto investors criticized that approach. Detractors warned that it could trigger a death spiral for LUNA should the stablecoin lose its peg. Further, Anchor also caught flak for representing more than half of the network’s TVL by using a reserve to subsidize yields; critics argued that Anchor’s yields are unsustainable. A new proposal to limit yield payouts has divided the Anchor community. Anchor’s critics were almost proved correct in February when the protocol asked the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) for $450M to maintain its high yields. Terra community members warned that without the funds, the Anchor Yield Reserve would be depleted by the end of the month, forcing the protocol to reduce its APYs. The LFG obliged, with Anchor predicting it could become self-sufficient by December thanks to its forthcoming v2 iteration. To mitigate the risks posed to LUNA, Terra’s founder, Do Kwon, has decided to back UST with Bitcoin reserves. The LFG raised $1B through private LUNA sales in February, with Kwon announcing earlier this month that Terraform Labs had donated an additional $1.2B after selling UST for Tether. The Tether will be mobilized to purchase Bitcoin, with blockchain sleuths identifying $125M being sent from LFG’s wallet on March 22. “As UST money supply grows, a portion of the seigniorage will go to build BTC reserves bridged to the Terra chain,” Kwon tweeted on March 23. He said Terra is hoping to build up a reserve of $10B worth in Bitcoin to back UST over time. “We will keep growing reserves until it becomes mathematically impossible for idiots to claim depeg risk for $UST,” Kwon tweeted on March 11. On March 24, Jump Trading, an algorithmic trading firm that participated in LFG’s February private sale, published a governance proposal outlining how the Bitcoin reserves could be deployed to maintain UST’s peg. During usual market conditions, retail traders would be able to purchase $1 worth of BTC from the LFG’s reserves in exchange for 1 UST. But in the event of a “crisis,” retail participants would be able to exchange 1 UST for slightly less than $1 worth of BTC. The proposal suggested that 1 UST be tradable for $0.98 BTC should the stablecoin severely lose its peg.  ']"

['Market Roundup: BSC Flexes its DEXes as Terra Surges'],"['DEXs are moving in recent market action. By: Samuel Haig Binance Smart Chain’s DEXes still rule. That’s the upshot of heavy action in the crypto markets as bulls battle bears to retake control of the narrative. Here’s a round-up of the latest moves in DEX volume, plus how Solana and Terra are faring against rivals and the latest with Ethereum Layer 2s. BSC’s TVL rocketed during the first half of 2021, surging to post a record high of $31.7B on May 10, 2021 after starting the year with $124M according to DeFi Llama. The once surging network slumped down to $11.4B earlier this month, its lowest level since April 2021. BSC now represents $12.2B after gaining 7%, but is still down 62% from its all-time high. Binance Smart Chain TVL. Source: DeFi Llama According to CoinGecko, BSC’s PancakeSwap, BiSwap, and Dodo currently rank as the second, third, and fourth by 24-hour volume among decentralized exchanges. They represent $474.7M, $446.3M, and $201.5M respectively. The exchanges combined represent 23.8% of the $4.7B traded on DEXes over the past 24 hours. BiSwap is surging at the moment, adding 29.6% to its TVL to rank seventh among BSC-based protocols with $425M. Its trade volume has rocketed into new all-time highs, surging by more than 10 times from $45.7M over the past 24 hours. Its native BSW token has responded with a 24-hour gain of 152% after listing on Binance’s centralized exchange yesterday. First they made a chain because of that cool kid Hayden.

During its December peak, PancakeSwap was processing more than $2B worth of trades daily. Dodo ranks as BSC’s 26th largest protocol with just $50M despite its impressive trade volume. Its normalized exchange volume is currently at an all-time high. Ethereum’s Uniswap v3 is the leading DEX by 24-hour activity with $1.47B or nearly one-third of combined DEX volume. Uniswap’s v2 iteration also ranks seventh with 156.6M in daily trades. Solana is up 5.75% after posting a six-month low of $6.6B earlier this month. The network carved significant market share away from Ethereum and BSC as it rocketed from a $600M TVL at the start of the third quarter last year to highs of $15B in November and December. But it too has been displaced by rival low-cost Layer 1 networks, with Solana shedding 53% of its TVL since topping out in early December. Solana TVL. Source: DeFi Llama Fantom is yet to recover from the aggressive loss of capital it experienced at the start of the month when technical advisor Andre Cronje and senior solutions architect Anton Nell announced they would exit DeFi. Although Fantom’s TVL bounced 8% to $6.74B, the network is down 44% since the start of the month. A bullish week for market action drove an 8.4% gain for the combined market cap of DeFi assets. The sector now represents $125B, its highest level in two months according to CoinGecko. Ethereum’s TVL bounced 8.6% this past week as top-ten protocols Curve, Aave, and Instadapp all enjoyed double-digit TVL growth. Fifth-ranked Lido posted the strongest bounce of Ethereum’s top 50 protocols, adding 34.5% to its locked assets. Ethereum currently represents $118.5B in locked assets, down by nearly 28% since its November all-time high. Ethereum’s Layer 2s also posted a strong week. The sector added 10.6% to its TVL, currently boasting a combined TVL of $6.2B according to L2beat. Ethereum Layer 2 combined TVL, 12-month chart. Source: L2beat Arbitrum’s TVL is above $3B for the first time in 18 days after adding 11.5% to its TVL. The network represents 50% of Ethereum’s combined Layer 2 TVL. Optimism grew by 24% to tag $530M and is now at its highest level since early January. The network is only 5% away from setting a new all-time high. Metis Andromeda’s growth was sluggish this past week, with the rollup network plateauing after tagging a record high of $743.7M on March 19. ZkSync grew by 85.3% this week, blasting past its previous February high of $95.2M to tag $140M. Yesterday, zkSync shared data from DappRadar indicating that its leading DEX, ZigZag, would rank as Ethereum’s 8th largest by unique users with 2,122 in 24 hours. The Terra network continues to grow, again posting new highs for TVL this week. Terra emerged as the leading low-cost Layer 1 network in late 2021, with its growth being propelled by the controversial fixed interest rate of roughly 20% offered by the network’s leading protocol, Anchor. While questions swirled regarding the sustainability of Anchor in February, the Luna Foundation Guard mobilized $450M to support its high yields until November. The move restored confidence in Terra, at least for now, driving a 50% increase in the network’s TVL over the past six weeks. Terra currently boasts a TVL of $27.2B and represents 21.7% of the combined DeFi capitalization.Anchor added 8.3% to its TVL this week. The protocol is now up 61.8% over the past month with $14.2B in total. Terra’s second-largest protocol, Lido, also added 93.4% to its TVL, bringing it to a cool $8.1B. The fourth-ranked Stader is up 148% with nearly $813M.  ']"

['Ether Bulls Ascendant as Anticipation Builds for The Merge'],"[""Don't look now but Ether is putting together a sustained rally. By: Samuel Haig After a bearish start to 2022, Ethereum market sentiment appears to be flipping bullish. The first quarter has been rough for Ethereum and DeFi, with ETH shedding a quarter of its value and the combined capitalization of DeFi assets falling 22%. The downturn prompted many analysts to declare the bull trend over, but Ether now appears poised to rally ahead of its highly anticipated Eth2 chain merge. On March 15, The Merge was successfully completed on the Kiln merge testnet, marking the final test of the chain merge before it is deployed to public testnets. Analysts took to Twitter to remind the community what can be expected when the Ethereum mainnet merges with the Eth2 Beacon Chain, forecasting a 90% reduction in Ether issuance and a more than 99% drop in energy consumption. The progress towards The Merge appears to be reflected by Ether’s recent bounce, with ETH gaining 14.4% since March 14. And institutions loading up their ETH bags. On March 17, Three Arrows Capital reportedly added 40,500 Ether worth $112M to its holdings. The move came despite the firm’s co-founder, Zhu Su, claiming to have “abandoned” Ethereum in November. On March 6, analytics firm Santiment reported that billionaire wallets have continued to accumulate despite the markets pulling back since November. It noted that ten-figure whales have added 2.2% of ETH’s supply to their wallets in the past six months. Ethereum just passed a big test as The Merge was completed. According to CoinShares, instruments tracking Ether represented also saw a significant uptick during February, despite the month’s choppy price action. Also on March 17, Ethereum researcher Alexander Fisher tweeted that a record 302,000 Ether ETH is currently in queue for staking activation. Many ETH holders have been deterred from staking by the current lack of withdrawal functionality for Ether locked up on the Eth2 Beacon Chain since it was launched in December 2020. With withdrawals expected to be enabled within months following The Merge, an increasing number of hodlers now appear willing to stake their ETH in spite of being able to withdraw their coins. Ethereum is currently the second-largest network by staked capitalization with $26.5B despite less than 8% of supply being staked currently and withdrawals not yet enabled. Willy Woo, a popular on-chain analyst, posted on March 18 that ETH appears poised to break above a long-term bearish trendline. Several of his followers chimed in with charts that similarly suggest an upward move may be incoming. “Crypto Rover” posted a chart to their 75,500 followers indicating that the bearish trend has already been broken on the ETH/BTC charts. However, Twitter user “PayneResidence” retorted that “trendlines are very subjective,” suggesting that Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) may offer a more accurate indicator. Their EMA chart suggests Ethereum may need to clear roughly $2,900 in order to break out of its current bearish range. Bill Barhydt, the CEO of centralized digital asset platform Abra, told CNBC on March 11 he believes ETH could soon surge to $40,000 amid increasing adoption of NFTs, DeFi, and GameFi. “The use cases are through the roof,” he said. “Ethereum’s network effect is based on this idea that it could become the world’s computers. It’s being used for stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi…, and gaming now.” However, his prediction is contingent on the network’s sky-high gas fees pulling back. “If the gas fees and the transaction fees come down, which is the promise of the Proof of Stake, look out, because now all of the impediments of those network effects are taken out of the way,” he said. Many believe that Ethereum’s fee woes will soon be behind it. While Layer 2 gas prices are already a fraction of what they are on mainnet, EIP-4488 and EIP-4490 are expected to slash the fees associated with transacting on roll-up networks by more than 80%.

Holders of Bored Ape NFTs, as well as Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), are entitled to claim APE tokens. So after it was released, the BAYC floor price spiked to 106 ETH from 92 ETH, a 13.2% jump, as buyers piled into NFTs. By 1 PM New York time, the BAYC floor price had dropped by a quarter, to 79.5 ETH before stabilizing at 89 ETH, according to CoinGecko data. As for APE, it’s sporting a whopping $746M market cap on its opening day. But the token is down 22% from its open, probably because investors are rapidly flipping it to pocket profits. BAYC’s floor price. Source CoinGecko BAYC holders can claim 10,094 APE tokens and (MAYC) holders will be able to claim 2,042, according to a page outlining the details of the project. Holders of both BAYC and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) or MAYC and BAKC are able to claim roughly an additional 900 tokens. In all, the claimable tokens amount to 150M, 15% of the 1B supply of APE. A dashboard by hildobby shows that 15,230 addresses are eligible for the drop with 51% of those already claiming as of Mar. 17. The project’s description focuses on culture. “APE is a token made to support what’s next, controlled and built on by the community.” reads ApeCoin’s about-page. “It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.” APE serves to govern ApeCoin DAO, which is a governance system in charge of what the project is calling its “Ecosystem Fund.” The fund will be seeded with some portion 470M, 47% of the APE supply, which the about-page says will be for the “DAO treasury and resources.” So far, there doesn’t seem to be consensus about how APE will perform. It’s hard to conceive of a token with more hype. “It’ll be really interesting to see how APE coin performs,” tweeted basedkarbon, an influencer. “They haven’t released enough information about the tokenomics yet for me to make any kind of determination on it.” Yuga Labs acquisition of CryptoPunks has triggered the NFT avatar community. Bored Ape is a project with a ton of buzz. Celebrities and athletes like Eminem, Justin Beiber, Stephen Curry, Paris Hilton, and Von Miller are all BAYC holders. It’s possible that a token will be a way for people to get involved with the project without needing to cash out a huge sum for a Bored Ape. That’s 36.1% up from BAYC’s 76.34 ETH floor on Mar. 11 when Yuga Labs announced their acquisition of CryptoPunks and Meebits’ intellectual property rights. Many of crypto’s most popular centralized exchanges are already on board with APE — Binance, Coinbase, and FTX have all enabled trading for the token. The project has also signed up Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, as one of five members of a special council as part of the APE Foundation, a centralized company. “The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way,” reads the project’s about-page. Crypto projects often lean on traditional companies at their outset in order to foster the growth of an entirely decentralized entity. Yat Siu, chairman of the board of Animoca Brands, a company which previously partnered with BAYC, is also on the special council. Siu has already made two proposals on ApeCoin’s governance forum, on behalf of Anomica, with both pertaining to staking.

And 14% of the token will go to launch contributors, which are described as “the companies and people that helped make this project a reality.” 10M of these, or 1% of the supply, will be unlocked at launch, with the rest locked for at least six months.

By: yyctrader This is what we call baking in the bad news. Crypto markets jumped modestly after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday by 0.25%, a hike that was widely expected by investors and was apparently factored into token prices leading up to the decision. Bitcoin ticked up 2.6% to $40,600, and Ether rose almost 3% in mid-afternoon trading New York time, according to data from CoinGecko. Prior to the decision, futures markets indicated a 98.3% probability of such a hike. Source: CME FedWatch Investors have been nervously watching the Fed as consumer prices surged 7% in 2021 to a 39-year high. The central bank signalled it would hike interest rates to rein in inflation, a move equity investors tend to dislike because it makes bonds more attractive. Crypto has been closely correlated with stocks for the last few months. Commodity prices are also skyrocketing, especially as Russia’s war on Ukraine shakes up the oil and natural gas markets as well as the production of metals and staples such as wheat. Now investors are bound to watch the Fed closely to see if it will take a more hawkish stance and increase rates even more. Such a move would likely be a bearish signal for asset prices including crypto, which is why we saw a global selloff in January after mere hints that loose monetary policy was drawing to an end.

['Messari Data Shows Flipping Airdrops is Twice as Profitable as Holding'],"['A Messari Data shows that quickly selling airdropped tokens pays off better than holding. By: Owen Fernau It appears that profit-seeking web3 users would have been better off selling their airdrops rather than holding them. A new dashboard developed by Messari data scientist, Yule Andrade, has revealed that selling each of the 10 most significant Ethereum airdrops a week after receiving them would be twice as profitable — or 112.5%, to be precise — as holding them. The 10 airdrops included dYdX, Uniswap, LooksRare, Gitcoin, and Ethereum Name Service. Specifically, a user who received the median number of tokens for each airdrop and sold them would have earned $108,393, according to Andrade’s dashboard. A portfolio that sold each airdrop a week later. Source: Messari A user who held the 10 airdrops until Mar. 10, would have a portfolio worth $30,349. Portfolio that held the airdrops. Source: Messari Andrade also provided portfolio values for people who sold airdrops two weeks, one month, and three months after receiving them, with decreases in returns the longer selling was postponed. Andrade’s data puts hard evidence to the idea that, for the profit-seeking user, airdrops should generally be sold quickly, rather than held. This flies in the face of the sentiment that airdrops are given to the community to allow them to steward a platform with governance. Brantly Millegan, who is still the director of operations at Ethereum Name Service, according to his LinkedIn, despite being embroiled in controversy, famously tweeted of the ENS airdrop: “you were not airdropped free money, you were airdropped responsibility.” With users generally better off selling their airdrops, it may be hard to convince them to stick around for both responsibility and a depressed portfolio. To be sure, not every airdrop was lower on Mar. 10 than a week after it dropped. The median airdrop of 400 of Uniswap’s UNI tokens, would’ve been worth $1,959 if sold a week after their Sept. 16 airdrop. Proving an exception to the rule, those tokens are now worth $3,686, according to Andrade’s dashboard. Gitcoin’s GTC is also up a modest 7% as of Mar. 10 against its June 1 price which is a week after its May 25 airdrop. The decentralized exchange aggregator, 1inch’s INCH token, is also up 13% against its one-week-past airdrop price. So not all tokens are necessarily better off sold. Plus there are other benefits outside of the scope of Andrade’s dashboard — people who received LOOKS, for example were able to receive ETH fees if they staked their airdropped tokens, making the And of course, the overall crypto market is down 20% in the last 90 days, making airdrop holders look particularly bad.

By: Owen Fernau Privacy coins were dead in the water, an afterthought for most of last year as the crypto market hit all-time highs and they languished. Now, the top two privacy coins, Monero’s XMR, and Zcash’s ZEC, are both up more than 25% on Tuesday before settling at 21% and 16% respectively in early morning trading U.K. time. What’s going on? Source: CoinGecko It’s a surprising pocket of resurgence in a generally bleak crypto market that has dropped 11.1%, in the last week.\xa0It’s hard to know precisely why these coins are moving. A well-known trader, who goes by Cuban, told The Defiant there are two potential catalysts for XMR and ZEC’s explosive price action. First is a new bill that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced this week. According to her Twitter, the bill will “ensure crypto isn’t used by Putin and his cronies to undermine economic sanctions.” Warren also wrote a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on March 2 that inquires about the cryptocurrency industry’s ability to comply with sanctions, especially those recently imposed on Russia. With the details of her bill not yet public, investors may be trying to get out in front of increased scrutiny and regulation by purchasing privacy coins, which, as their name suggests, enable users to keep their transactions’ origins and destinations confidential. The second factor driving XMR and ZEC is news that the Russian central bank is restricting the sale of foreign currencies, Cuban said. The move leaves Russians potentially trapped holding roubles, which has collapsed to historic lows against the U.S. dollar since sanctions were imposed.\xa0Russians may be buying privacy coins to preserve purchasing power and maintain the ability to transact freely, which coins like XMR and ZEC enable, at least theoretically. And of course, crypto is full of traders trying to profit rather than actually use privacy tokens. One such trader, who goes by Depression BTC, appears to have entered a leveraged long position on Mar. 7, according to his Twitter, the day before the massive jump. “Holy sh*t ZEC XMR sending,” the trader tweeted on Mar. 8 as the assets took off.

Nell announced that he and Cronje will “close” their respective “chapter[s] of contributing to the DeFi/crypto space,” noting they will hand over all existing responsibilities with roughly 25 projects by April 3.

Its total value locked (TVL) is also down 6% overall since Cronje’s departure was announced, although its Fantom deployment has lost more than 46% in one week. The Fantom (FTM) team also responded to the news by emphasizing that the network “isn’t and never was a one man team.” It added that there are currently more than 40 people working on Fantom. Regardless, the price of gas on Fantom surged to more than 10,000 gwei as users raced to reduce exposure to protocols associated with Cronje. Despite the team’s best efforts at placating fears in the market FTM is down 22% since Fell’s tweet went live.

['DeFi Blue Chips Slide 80% Since 2021 as New Generation Rises'],"[""DeFi 1.0 blue chips such as Uniswap are as influential as ever but their tokens are fading as a new breed emerges. By: Samuel Haig A new generation of DeFi projects — Terra, Fantom — have had a blistering run in the last 30 days. The old guard, let’s call them DeFi 1.0 blue chips, not so much. We’re talking Uniswap, Aave, MakerDAO, Compound, and other members of that DeFi Summer generation. They command more than $50B in total value locked (TVL) and by that measure, they are as formidable as ever. But when it comes to token performance, well, the new entrants are leaving them in the dust: Uniswap has recorded a 6% increase in the last 30 days compared to a 38.7% jump by Terra’s LUNA token. The fact is, most DeFi 1.0 blue-chip assets have plummeted by more than 80% against both USD and ETH since the first half of 2021 and no longer rank among the top 50 cryptocurrencies, despite many protocols’ TVLs peaking in Q4 2021. Here’s a rundown of what’s happening: Decentralized money market Compound was a major catalyst for DeFi Summer after it launched liquidity mining incentives for borrowers and lenders with its governance token COMP in June 2020. Compound was not the first DeFi protocol to launch liquidity mining on Ethereum, with Synthetix having rewarded sETH/ETH liquidity providers on Unsiwap v1 with its SNX token in 2019. However, with Compound rewarding its community simply for using the protocol and not requiring they take on the risks of impermanent loss associated with providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange, its yield farming incentives quickly led to a flurry of activity on the platform. Compound emerged as the top protocol by TVL for much of DeFi Summer, dethroning the sector’s long-time leader, MakerDAO, in the process. The protocol also inspired institutions to explore DeFi after partnering with institutional digital asset custodian Fireblocks. Although Compound is the seventh-largest protocol on Ethereum, its token is down more than 87% against the dollar compared to its all-time high in May 2021. COMP has fared even worse against Ether, crashing by 96% since June 2020. A new wave of DeFi players are trying to entice traditional savers with juicy yields. The launch of Uniswap’s v2 iteration in May 2020 was helped ignite the explosion of DeFi by enabling permissionless token swaps without being mediated by a centralized exchange. While Uniswap v1 had launched in November of 2018, the protocol required all trades to be executed using ETH as an intermediate base pair, incurring additional fees and slippage for users. Uniswap airdropped its token to users after facing liquidity vampire attacks from rival DEXes such as Yam Finance and SushiSwap, which offered significant incentives in the form of governance tokens to liquidity providers who migrated their capital away from Uniswap. The DEX would then go on to pioneer concentrated liquidity with the launch of its v3 iteration in May 2021.  Uniswap is now the ninth-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $7.53B, while the exchange processed more than $1.5B in volume across its v2 and v3 deployments in the last 24 hours. Even so, the price of Uniswap has fallen dramatically since its early 2021 all-time highs. Currently trading for $9.21 or 0.00337 ETH, the price of UNI has crashed 79.3% in fiat terms since its May 2021 high, and 83% against ETH since posting a record high in March 2021. The success of Yearn Finance, a pioneering yield aggregation protocol, catapulted its founder, Andre Cronje, to fame. COMP’s success inspired Yearn to launch its governance token YFI in July 2020. Cronje urged users to earn the token by providing liquidity to one of the protocols in the Yearn ecosystem, rather than purchase it on exchanges. Yearn and Cronje have been mired in several controversies. And the protocol is Ethereum’s tenth largest and ranks 14th overall for the sector. Yet YFI has declined 76.7% against USD since its May 2021 high. The token has fared even worse against Ether, shedding 93% since trading for a whopping 111.9 ETH September 2020. Synthetix was a darling of the early DeFi sector, with SNX holders enjoying eye-watering gains as the token rallied from just a few cents to more than $28 at its peak in early February 2021. Synthetix continues to power many innovative DeFi protocols, with recently launched derivatives trading protocols including Lyra and Kwenta being powered by Synthetix. Yet Synethetix has suffered a brutal 13 months, hemorrhaging 70% of its TVL since peaking at $3B last February. Synthetix is now just the 40th-largest protocol with $874.5M locked. The SNX token has fared even worse, crashing 86.8% against USD since peaking last February. It is also down 92% since topping out against Ether in September 2020. MakerDAO, Ethereum’s first protocol enabling users to mint a decentralized stablecoin against ETH collateral, is the second-largest DeFi protocol by TVL with $15.5B locked. Despite launching way back in December 2017, the success of its stablecoin, DAI, has allowed MakerDAO to remain a leading DeFi protocol. Its TVL peaked at roughly $20B in December and MakerDAO continues to closely vie with Curve for the distinction of Ethereum’s largest protocol. Yet the MKR token has dipped 69% since topping out in May 2021 compared to the dollar. MKR also peaked against Ether way back in March 2019 and has steadily fallen by nearly 87% since. MKR has bounced by just 22% since posting an all-time low against ETH in November. MakerDAO's vote to expel its content production team signal a tougher line on governance. Aave launched in January 2017, then called ETHLend, before rebranding to Aave in September of 2018. The protocol would go on to pioneer flash loans and overtook Compound as the top decentralized money market by TVL last year. It currently ranks as the fifth-largest DeFi protocol by cross-chain TVL with $12B locked. Its recent Polygon and Avalanche deployments were a major catalyst for adoption on the networks, currently ranking as the largest protocol on both. Its platform for institutional investors, Aave Arc, has drawn a lot of attention from family offices and private banks. Despite peaking with a TVL of roughly $19.5B in October, Aave is down 80.4% against USD since its May 2021 high, and has cratered by 84.8% relative to ETH since its peak in Feb 2021. Curve, a decentralized exchange for low-slippage stablecoin swaps, emerged as the leading DeFi protocol by TVL in 2021, peaking at more than $24.1B in January. Its growth was propelled by deployments on low-cost Layer 1s and Layer 2 scaling networks, in addition to the surging growth enjoyed by Convex Finance, a protocol bolstering the yields of Curve’s liquidity providers and CRV holders, in the second half of 2021. Convex is currently the fourth-largest DeFi protocol. Curve’s growth also drove significant gains for CRV holders as the token gained 380% to $6.51 from $1.36 in July. Yet much of the gains were quickly erased, with CRV losing 63% of its value in the past two months. Curve's symbiotic relationship with Convex is the focus of a new governance proposal that zeroes in on an unusual rule. When compared to ETH, CRV is also down nearly 39% in 12 months. It has also shed 92% since bouncing two weeks after launching in September 2020 — roughly two weeks after it began trading on exchanges. Decentralized finance collective, Index Coop, launched its DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) token in September 2020. The index token is designed to offer market cap-weighted exposure to the top tokens from the DeFi sector. It currently tracks the governance tokens of Uniswap, MakerDAO, Aave, Loopring, Synthetix, Yearn Finance, SushiSwap, Compound, Ren, Rari Capital, Kyber Network, Balancer, BadgerDAO, and Harvest Finance. DPI surged by 900% in roughly six months, peaking at $633 in May 2021 after trading for just $62 in November 2020. However, the index token has since cratered alongside DeFi 1.0 assets. DPI last traded hands for $156, a 75% drawdown from its record highs. It is also down 79% against ETH since rallying in March 2021. ""]"

['Terra and Fantom Are Pumping Even as DeFi TVL and Ethereum Burn Rate Drag'],"[""Terra and Fantom have rebounded in the last seven days but overall DeFi TVL's uptick is modest. By: Samuel Haig DeFi tokens are rallying. Terra is up 54% in the last seven days, and Fantom has spiked 21%. Indeed, six of the top 100 by market cap are up by more than 50% over the past seven days, and 40 are enjoying double-digit gains for the week according to CoinGecko. The combined DeFi market cap is almost $122B after slipping below $100B on Feb. 22. Yet the growth of the sector’s total value locked (TVL) has been more modest, with Ethereum and Solana up just 5% from their respective local lows, while Binance Smart Chain and Polygon have bounced by 3%, according to DeFiLlama. Ethereum’s burn rate has also plummeted, currently sitting at 3.68 ETH per minute on average for the past week — a drop of more than two-thirds from its January highs. So is DeFi activity declining? Or has it migrated away from the chains that drove the 2021 boom for decentralized finance? One factor is the velocity with which the sector’s market cap fell amid the recent downturn, with most leading tokens losing at least half of their value. By contrast, the combined DeFi TVL dropped by 27% between late November and early February. Terra has resumed its rise toward the top of the DeFi rankings. Its TVL has surged to new all-time highs to tag $23.5B, almost double its level five weeks ago. The network’s top four protocols posted dramatic growth in recent weeks. Terra’s largest protocol Anchor is up 63% in 30 days, which is followed by Lido with a 68% gain, and Stader with 179%. However, Anchor and Lido account for 82.5% of the network’s TVL, highlighting that Terra’s performance has been driven by the growth of just a few protocols. Terra TVL. Source: DeFi Llama Anchor’s growth comes after the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) injected $450M into the protocol to continue subsidizing its roughly 20% yields. The move followed a Feb. 8 governance proposal calling on the LFG to step in and rescue its treasury from depleting by the end of February. Researcher ‘N3mo’ predicted that Anchor will be self-sufficient come November. Terra’s native LUNA token has followed with a gain of 55.9% in seven days. The token currently represents 28.5% of the combined DeFi market cap with nearly $34.8B, and ranks the seventh-largest crypto asset overall. LUNA is now just 10% shy of its all-time high, having almost fully recovered from the loss of more than 50% it sustained during January. Fantom has also posted surging growth in recent days. Fantom’s TVL is currently at $11.65B, up more than 60% from $7.25B on Feb. 22. The majority of Fantom’s recovery can be attributed to Solidly, a new DEX from Yearn Finance founder, Andre Cronje, and Solidex, a yield optimizer built on top of Solidly. The two protocols have grown by 500% and 718% in the past seven days respectively, adding roughly $4B to Fantom’s TVL between them. The network’s top dapp, Multichain, has also posted a strong week with TVL growth of more than 33.5%. Multichain now represents a TVL of more than $6B. Fantom TVL. Source: DeFi Llama Fantom’s FTM token has bounced 20.7% amid the impressive growth. Despite the gain, FTM is still down 45.5% from its October all-time high. Avalanche has held strong in recent weeks. The network’s TVL posted a strong recovery from its late January lows of $8.1B, pushing above $10B roughly one week later. While other leading networks saw a secondary retracement during February, Avalanche has not slipped below $10B since early February. Avalanche’s TVL is currently $11.2B. Seven of the network’s top ten protocols have posted double-digit growth over the past 30 days. Aave leads with $3.3B after gaining 33%, followed by TraderJoe with $1.5B and a 26% gain, while Curve rounds out the top three with $1.2B after gaining 26.6% for the month.

"[""Russia's Invasion Triggers 6% Premium on BTC-Ukrainian Hryvnia Trade""]","['The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked a 6% premium in the BTC-Ukrainian Hryvnia trading pair. By: Owen Fernau Wildly divergent spreads used to be a staple in Bitcoin trading, with savvy traders raking in profits by playing the arbitrage between the pricing on different exchanges, especially in Asia. Now a 6% premium for BTC has emerged on a trading pair with the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH), the nation’s currency, as Russia’s invasion of its smaller neighbor roils the crypto markets and burnishes Bitcoin’s role as a form of digital gold. The premium exists on WhiteBIT, which is the most popular exchange in Russia, according to bitrawr, which ranks exchanges on a per country basis. More than a third of WhiteBIT’s traffic comes from Russian users and 13% comes from Ukrainian ones, according to similarweb, which tracks website traffic. WhiteBIT’s fiat trading pairs. Converting WhiteBIT’s BTC-UAH price to dollars prices the cryptocurrency at $46,167, while the price shown on CoinGecko at the same time, 8PM New York time, is $43,541. Premiums on digital assets have been known to emerge during times of strife. Ukrainians may be fleeing to BTC and other digital assets, causing the premium to emerge — USDT is trading at $1.12, as opposed to its $1 peg, on Kuna, a Ukrainian exchange. Kuna is the most popular exchange in Ukraine, according to bitrawr, though its daily volume is a relatively low $2.1M, according to CoinGecko. WhiteBIT’s volume is much higher — its $733M volume makes it the 28th largest exchange in crypto by that metric and according to CoinGecko.Like WhiteBIT, Kuna’s BTC-UAH pair prices BTC at a premium when compared to the BTC-USDT pair, even before accounting for USDT’s own heightened price on the Ukrainian exchange. As further evidence that interest in crypto is spiking in countries affected by the war there has been a massive spike in trades between BTC and the ruble, Russia’s currency, according to Kaiko, a crypto data provider. While BTC is up 14% against the dollar, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is up 42.3% against the ruble, according to CoinGecko. The ruble has lost 24.4% of its value against the dollar, according to Yahoo Finance. The total crypto market cap up 10.4% in dollar terms over the last 24 hours, and Bitcoin has shaken off its bearish tendencies of late and surged almost 17% in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko data. Ether, too, has rallied 12.6% in mid-morning trading U.K. time. The hard sanctions Western governments have imposed on Russia are quickly changing the narrative around digital assets this year. The European Union, Canada, and the U.S. have agreed to sever Russian banks from the SWIFT cross-border payment system and froze the country’s foreign-currency reserves. Kraken Co-founder Jesse Powell, said there is pressure to block Russian users of the platform as retaliation for the invasion. It was only a couple of weeks ago that the conventional wisdom held that Bitcoin’s role as a store of value was moribund. Now crypto’s leaders say the crisis reinforces the thesis behind blockchain-based assets. “Bitcoin was invented so politicians can’t delete your money by changing a number in a database,” tweeted Robert Leshner, founder of Compound Finance.

['Markets Bounce Back From Ukraine Invasion Rout'],"['Global markets reversed earlier losses in roller-coaster day. By: yyctrader Crypto markets are trading higher today with major cryptocurrencies recovering most of their losses over the past two days. Bitcoin is up 11% to $39,400 in the past 24 hours and Ether has surged 14% to $2,720. In the early hours of Feb. 24, global markets nosedived after Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine. Bitcoin dropped 9% to as low as $34,500. Altcoins fared worse, with Ethereum dropping nearly 12% to an intraday low of $2300 before paring some losses.  Global markets staged a dramatic reversal after news broke that US president Joe Biden would not commit American troops to the conflict in Ukraine. Fears of escalation seem to have subsided for now and investors are showing a renewed appetite for risk. Despite the sharp drop in prices, liquidations on major exchanges remained under $500M, according to data provider Coinglass. This is much lower than we’ve seen during previous sell-offs, perhaps a sign that investors are being more careful when taking on leveraged positions in light of the geopolitical situation and the US Fed’s much-anticipated March meeting. Still, not everyone is convinced that the rally has legs. “The prospect of geopolitical escalation has been the main driver of price moves in the broader risk asset spectrum for the past couple of weeks. Now that the war between Russia and Ukraine has become reality, investors are rushing to take risk off the table and stock markets globally are seeing major declines,” said Anto Paroian, Chief Operating Officer at digital asset investment fund ARK36. “Given how closely the crypto markets have been correlated with risk assets over the past two months, it doesn’t come as a surprise that the situation is aggressively spilling into the crypto markets with Bitcoin losing more than 8% in a day,” he continued. Ruud Feltkamp, CEO of crypto trading bot Cryptohopper, said “First of all, I would like to say that I am shocked by the attack on Ukraine. My thoughts go out to the residents and the Cryptohopper colleagues there. I find it unimaginable that this can still happen in 2022. I’ve been closely watching the markets for a while and was very curious how the Bitcoin price would react to this. I honestly think it’s doing pretty ok. Regardless of the war, I expected a slight move down anyway, after which another $40k retest is expected. Whether this will still happen is, of course, the question.” ']"

['Cosmos Ecosystem Quietly Surges to $17B in TVL in Challenge to Ethereum Layer 2s'],"['The Cosmos ecosystem has bucked the crypto selloff and quietly surged into second place in TVL. By: Owen Fernau This was supposed to be the Cosmos’ ecosystem banner year. And in a way, it already is. By itself Terra, a blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (software development kit), is the No. 3 ranking chain in total value locked (TVL) terms at $17.32B as of Feb. 16, according to DeFi Llama. TVL is a metric which represents the assets locked in a blockchain’s smart contracts and is an approximate proxy for a chain’s usefulness. Terra trails Avalanche by just $40M in TVL and Ethereum by a whopping $144.08B. But looking at other leading Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Cosmos, and Crypto.com’s Cronos chain, all of which were built using Cosmos’ SDK and are connected via the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, it’s clear the entire ecosystem is actually the second ranked in TVL terms by over $3B as of Feb. 17. A diagram of the Cosmos Chains connected by the IBC protocol. Osmosis has $1.41B in TVL and Cronos has $2.43B, according to DeFi Llama, but few of the IBC enabled chains show up on DeFi Llama’s TVL-by-chain list. That the Cosmos ecosystem is No 2 is surprising. “Cosmos has traditionally had an issue with marketing and getting the word out there,” said Shane Vitarana, co-founder of Stargaze, an NFT launchpad and marketplace, on a podcast on the YouTube channel, Confident in Crypto, this month. Last month Stargaze airdropped 25% of its STARS token to people staking ATOM tokens, which secure Cosmos’ chain, and OSMO stakers and liquidity providers as well. The project is the fourth-ranked Cosmos chain in terms of IBC transfers, according to Map of Zones which tracks and visualizes the ecosystem. OSMO and JUNO, the token for Juno, a platform for interoperable smart contracts, have both airdropped to ATOM stakers (Last week’s DeFi Alpha provides a walkthrough for how to stake ATOM). So while the Cosmos ecosystem is still relatively quiet, people are starting to take notice. Before the market tanked on Feb. 17 three of the top four 24-hour gainers were for Cosmos chains — ATOM, OSMO, and JUNO. Vitarana says it’s more than the “free money” that’s bolstering the Cosmos tokens. “I don’t think it’s just the airdrops,” the Stargaze co-founder told The Defiant. “I think the multichain thesis has taken hold and people are starting to explore. The UX is much better than on Ethereum Layer 2s and the word is getting out.” This is supposed to be the year Ethereum Layer 2s (L2s), which execute transactions off the main chain (Layer 1), flex their muscles. The meme “L222”, which can be found in Ethereum supporters like Synthetix founder Kain Warwick’s Twitter name, exemplifies this push. Blue Kirby, a crypto influencer who has been banging the drum on OSMO, among other Cosmos tokens the airdrops have certainly helped push the ecosystem forward. “OSMO and JUNO airdropped to ATOM stakers. Those people got rich. OSMO and JUNO stakers are now getting more airdrops and getting richer,” the influencer told The Defiant. “So I’d say the interchain community is having a lot of fun right now that some people are missing out on.” Despite the positive price movement early in the day, ATOM, JUNO, OSMO, are all in the red in the past 24-hours as crypto has lost 5.5% of its market cap. With the Cosmos ecosystem quietly taking the No. 2 spot in TVL there may be an alternative narrative that comes to define 2022.  ']"

"[""Stablecoin Supply's Steady Rise Shows 'Increased Belief' in Digital Assets Despite Market Rout""]","['Stablecoin supply has steadily increased during the crypto market rout. By: Owen Fernau Anyone paying attention to crypto in the last three months knows it has been anything but calm. There’s been jaw-dropping doxes and nine-figure hacks, all while the market has lost a staggering $1T in value since November. At the same time, the supply of stablecoin has continued to increase despite the crypto market plummeting 32.2% to $2.08T as of Feb. 16 after hitting an all-time high of $3.07T on Nov. 8, according to CoinGecko. Stablecoin supply has increased the same amount, 32.2%, to $176.73B from $141.0B during those 100 days, according to data provided by The Block, an information services provider for digital assets. So what’s going on? The uptick in stablecoin supply may suggest the simple inevitability of blockchain-based assets, even in the more risk-off environment in crypto that we’ve seen for the past three months or so. “Stablecoin supply increasing still makes sense because it’s a symbol of secular increase in belief in digital assets, but not necessarily being risk-on those assets in current market conditions,” Jack Melnick, who does research for The Tie, an information services provider for businesses, told The Defiant.  Stablecoin supply has picked up somewhat since the market topped. Source: The Block Melnick sees holding U.S. dollars as increasingly hard to justify considering inflation hit 9.7% over the last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means consumer purchasing power — and the value of savings — fell sharply. Plus while benchmark interest rates are expected to increase, the interest rate on the one-year Treasury bill, known as the risk-free rate, is still only 1.01% as of Feb. 16. That’s about a percentage point lower than the rates offered by lending protocols Aave and Compound for USDC, USDT, and DAI, which are the top three stablecoins lent through both projects. Moreover, savings rates in the U.S. are still at 0.06%, according to Bankrate, making even stablecoins’ most run-of-the-mill rate of 2% look pretty tempting to American consumers. Overall, stablecoins’ increasing supply is a murky dynamic, and one not entirely driven by demand, institutional or otherwise. In November, shortly after the crypto peak, Terra governance voted to burn 88.86M LUNA tokens, worth over $3.5B at the time, exchanging them for UST, the project’s algorithmic stablecoin. In a nutshell, it at least appears that while appetite for risk-on assets has decreased in the past three months-plus the hunger for stablecoins hasn’t decreased.  ']"

['Reversal in NFT Market Triggers Plunge in Ethereum Burn Rate'],"[""Falling NFT activity is triggering a plunge in Ethereum's burn rate. By: Samuel Haig Declining activity in the NFT markets led to a plunge in Ethereum’s burn rate in February, according to Ultrasound Money, a data aggregator tracking activity on the Ethereum network. Surging activity in the NFT markets has been a major catalyst for the recently record-breaking burn rate on Ethereum. Whenever complex tasks take place on the Ethereum network — minting NFTs, for instance — ETH is eliminated or burned in accordance with the EIP-1559 upgrade. A recent boom in the popularity of NFTs has seen the sector’s leading marketplace, OpenSea, dominate Ethereum’s burn rankings in recent months, consistently representing more than 15% of all ETH destroyed. LooksRare, a recently launched rival, also contributed to the high burn rate, ranking fifth by ETH destroyed less than one week after launching. While OpenSea enjoyed record volumes last month, LooksRare handled even more action. LooksRare attracted the lion’s share of NFT volume after airdropping its governance token to OpenSea users and launching an aggressive liquidity mining campaign in early January. However, activity on LooksRare has crashed since its liquidity mining rewards were chopped in half on Feb. 10. The LOOKS token last changed hands for $7.10, and roughly 70% drawdown since Jan 20 according to CoinGecko. And this week OpenSea reclaimed its position as the top NFT marketplace by daily volume, beating out LooksRare for three of the past four days. According to Ultrasound Money, Ethereum’s burn rate is down by about two-thirds since mid-January, falling to 4.5 Ether every minute after trending above 12 ETH per minute last month. The figure is also down by one-third over the past week, slipping from 7 Ether every minute on Feb. 8.  LooksRare burst onto the scene by airdropping its native LOOKS token to wallets that had traded at least three Ether worth of NFTs between June 16 and Dec. 16 last year, and also listed an NFT for sale on the platform. Users received between 125 LOOKS and 10,000 LOOKS depending on the volume of their activity. LooksRare took aim at OpenSea’s centralized structure. While OpenSea pockets a 2.5% trading fee on all trades, LooksRare’s liquidity mining program redistributed its 2% trading fees back to users during its first month of operations. However, LooksRare’s liquidity incentives came under fire, with opportunistic traders found to be wash-trading royalty-free collections on the platform. Despite LooksRare’s recently eclipsing OpenSea by trade volume, its user base is a fraction of OpenSea’s. LooksRare’s daily user count peaked at nearly 3,500 on Feb. 2, while OpenSea hosted 80,801 unique traders on the same day according to Dune Analytics. Activity on LooksRare has sharply fallen since the rewards earned through its liquidity mining program were halved on Feb. 10. Daily volume has crashed, sliding below $200M in recent days after trending above $400M for the majority of January. Daily protocol revenues for LooksRare also tanked in response, trending between $2.9M and $4.5M since Feb. 10 after sitting between $10M and $16M during most of January. By contrast, OpenSea’s 24-hour revenue is near $2M after hovering between $2.5M and $6M during January. OpenSea’s volumes have declined sharply in February, slipping below $100M worth of trade on Feb. 14. OpenSea enjoyed record volume last month, processing more than $5B worth of transactions during January. According to Dune Analytics, daily trade was above $150M for roughly three-quarters of January, including a high of almost $250M worth of trade on Jan. 28. The floor prices of major NFT collections appear to have largely weathered the drop in trade activity. According to NFT Price Floor, Bored Ape Yacht Club has not moved over the past week at 99 ETH, and is down roughly 9% for the fortnight after posting an all-time high of 118.7 ETH on Feb. 1. CryptoPunks is down 14.6% in 14 days, having fallen from 84 ETH at the start of February. Activity on leading decentralized exchange Uniswap has also declined steeply since the mid-January high, albeit less violently than on NFT marketplaces. Uniswap v3’s burn rate has fallen by half since its local top, sitting at 542 ETH after peaking above 1,200 in mid-January, according to Ultrasound Money. However, the share of the daily burn represented by Uniswap has been growing amid the drop in NFT activity. Uniswap v3 drove 8.8% of Ether burned in the past week, up from 5.3% when February began.

['Smooth Love Potion Soars 70% in 24 Hours Behind Axie Infinity Update'],"['Smooth Love Potion, the token attached to Axie Infinity, is soaring after a major update. By: Owen Fernau Smooth Love Potion, a token earned by playing Axie Infinity, has been a white knuckle ride in recent months. In its latest turn, the token has soared almost 70%, to $0.034 in mid-morning trading U.K. time. The momentum pushed Smooth Love Potion’s (SLP) market cap to $1.1B. SLP’s 14-day chart. Source: CoinGecko The token is the highest gainer of the top 300 coins in the past 24-hours as of Feb. 9. The apparent catalyst is a change to Axie’s game mechanics as a part Season 20 update, which was posted to the project’s Substack on Feb. 3. Season 20 makes two major cuts to SLP emissions, which together will reduce daily increases in token supply by 165M, according to the project’s estimations. It’s a big moment for Axie. The project is the flagship of the play-to-earn economy and was celebrated for supplementing or replacing people’s income, but even at the $0.03 mark, SLP is down over 92% from the token’s all-time high of $0.40 which came on July 13. SLP has been down for awhile, putting a damper on a project which was beating even Ethereum in fees last August. “While we’ve all experienced the euphoria that comes with incredible growth and prosperity, we’ve also more recently entered into a period of economic uncertainty,” read Axie’s Season 20 post. Indeed the 180-day chart for SLP looks grim compared with the 14-day one. SLP’s 180-day chart. Source: CoinGecko Still, the past 24 hours have proved that Axie and its SLP token are still fighting. The project has over a million people in its four Discord servers, making Axie one of crypto’s largest communities. The Season 20 update concedes that if the project does nothing it risks economic collapse. So far, the changes appear to be working, or at least helping SLP’s price. The first major change of Season 20 is the removal of the 50 SLP which players earn from what’s called “adventure mode,” according to the update. Adventure mode is a version of the game which can be played alone, as opposed to against other players. Axie says that roughly 40% of the SLP is created through adventure mode and that the change means 120M less tokens will be created daily. “Adventure mode was originally conceived as a way for the community to learn how to use their Axies,” read the update. “It has outlived its purpose as a way for people to earn tokens from the game.” Season 20’s second major change to SLP mechanics also involves cutting emissions entirely from “daily quests,” which is a set of tasks such as completing a certain amount of one-on-one matches as well as adventure mode levels. According to Axie this will reduce SLP emissions by 45M per day. The update also touches on upcoming burn mechanics, whereby users will be able to spend their SLP on digital objects like skins, in-game emojis, and to use the token as buy-in for tournaments among other uses.

The weekly burn rate dropped to roughly 7 ETH every minute from 8.34 ETH, and is down nearly 42% in the past month. Roughly 70,150 ETH were destroyed in seven days, bringing the total number of ETH burnt to more than 1.79 million since EIP-1559 went live. OpenSea was the largest source of burnt Ether with 12,384 ETH wiped from circulation during February so far, followed by ETH transfers with 6,313 ETH, Uniswap v3 with 4,618 ETH, and Tether with 2,045 ETH. DeFi’s bounce back into contention comes as an increasing number of analysts are tipping that the sector will again take crypto’s center stage during 2022. In a Feb. 7 interview with Stockhead, Gunnar Jaerv, the COO of digital asset services firm First Digital Trust, predicted that traditional financial institutions will drive growth for the sector this year. “There is a lot of appetite,” said Jaerv, adding that the sector has matured “since its early anarchistic days. If you look at what’s happening around up today. It’s actually largely commercial. It’s Enterprise.” A Feb. 1 report from ConsenSys noted that the total number of unique DeFi addresses had produced steady growth amid the market downturn. They described the metric as “a worthy pulse on the overall health of the DeFi ecosystem, suggesting price action would begin to recover should unique addresses continue to grow. On Jan. 21, Huobi published a report offering their own take on the prediction that institutions will drive the next growth phase for DeFi. The analysis predicts institutions will converge on protocols offering undercollateralized lending solutions, noting that TrueFi has issued $1B worth of credit within its first year of operating. $4.35M unique addresses have currently interacted with DeFi protocols. Huobi also anticipates the recent growth in the low-cost Layer 1 and cross-chain dapps will accelerate during 2022. However, other onlookers believe DeFi may be in store for new challenges in 2022, including a crackdown from regulators. A Feb. 3 report from JP Morgan predicts DeFi will soon face a regulatory reckoning. The report claims the governance tokens of leading protocols including Uniswap, Synthetic, and Compound constitute unregulated “pseudo-equities” that “provide token holders with claims on future cash flows generated on DeFi protocols.” “These are not registered as securities even though they sure act like them,” Cembalest added. The report’s author, Michael Cembalest — JP Morgan’s chairman of market and investment strategy — also took aim at the frequent “rehypothecation” of capital within the DeFi sector, suggesting the practice is synonymous with “financial crisis.”  ']"

['Decoupling of NFTs and Crypto Spurs Debate About Future of New Asset Class'],"['The separation of the NFT market from the larger crypto market may mark a watershed in their evolution. By: Samuel Haig Just a month into the new year, the crypto market is confronting a riddle: Why are NFTs soaring while digital assets plunge into bear territory? NFTs and tokens have definitely decoupled. Monthly volume on OpenSea, the leading NFT marketplace, hit an all-time high of nearly $5B this week and the floor price of leading collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) jumped 50% in January, according to CoinGecko. NFT sales continue to make gaudy headlines — on Jan. 31, a BAYC NFT sold for $2.7M. Meanwhile, Terra’s LUNA token, a one-time DeFi darling, has shed half its value in the last 30 days. The crypto market as a whole lost a quarter of its capitalization in January. So what’s going on? Are NFTs, as skeptics argue, a bubble that’s just lagging the crypto market’s swoon? Or, as enthusiasts contend, are NFTs a new pop culture staple supported by sustainable demand? The latter idea has taken root as NFTs have rapidly gone mainstream. Artists, collectors, and a young generation of crypto newbies have embraced them. So, too, have professional sports leagues, entertainment conglomerates, and a galaxy of celebrities. The family of John Lennon recently\xa0announced an NFT drop. “Investors and collectors of NFTs seem to be a different breed than regular crypto investors,” Yohann Calpu, the chief marketing officer of NFT data aggregator CryptoSlam, told The Defiant. “They are in it not just for profits alone, but for identity, community, belonging, and an emotional connection with the art — this is why we are seeing a pullback in general crypto but an increase in sales on the NFT side.” There is a rising chorus of voices who agree with Calpu’s argument. CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong told The Defiant that the recent strength of NFTs suggests there are many “NFT holders who may not overlap with the core crypto community, which sold off assets during the recent downturn.” “NFT holders may have a longer time horizon, have a stronger belief in the strength of NFTs, and may hold it for other non-financial reasons,” he added. Pedro Herrera, a senior blockchain analyst at DappRadar, added that “the boost provided by the involvement of celebrities and big brands in the space is important, the social reach and influence power of these individuals cannot be taken lightly.” Even the Fortune 500 crowd believe something fundamental is shifting in the digital assets space. Bob Iger, the recently retired CEO of Disney, recently told The New York Times the current NFT “explosion” will continue to gather momentum. “We forget, in our generation, that things don’t have to be physical,” he told columnist Kara Swisher. They can be digital, and they have meaning to people. As long as that meaning can be essentially substantiated in a blockchain, I think you’re going to see an explosion of things being created, traded, and collected in NFTs,” he added.  NFT avatars are driving much of the action. “Avatar collections have performed well over the past few months as people seek a digital identity in the metaverse/internet,” Calpu said. He added that strong demand for freshly launched avatar collections including CloneX, Azuki, and Doodles “show that the avatar market is still hot and will continue to be hot as more collectors enter the scene.” Azuki has rocketed to rank as the second-most traded NFT collection just 20 days after minting, having pushed $258.4M worth of trade in total. Azuki’s floor price is also gaining quickly, having doubled over roughly the past week. CloneX, which launched in November, ranks fourth with $163.4M, further evidencing that new projects are capturing significant market share in the current bullish conditions. By contrast, activity for veteran projects CryptoPunks and Axie Infinity is at approximately $118M each — a monthly decline of 26% and 54.5% respectively. CryptoPunks and Axie Infinity currently rank fifth and sixth by monthly volume. However, both Bored Apes and Mutant Apes have seen a significant uptick in volume and price in recent weeks, with the projects ranking first and third by total activity. The Ethereum network represents the lion’s share of NFT trade, hosting $3.7B worth of activity over the past 30 days, despite the recent buzz surrounding NFTs launching on low-cost Layer 1 networks. CryptoSlam estimates that Chiliz-based fan tokens drove $1.1B in the past 30 days, followed by Solana with $180M, Axie Infinity’s Ronin chain with $118M, and Dapper Labs’ Flow with $61.8M. Calpu also emphasized the speed at which NFT activity is growing on rival networks, noting that sales on fifth-ranked Avalanche more than quadrupled during January. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, Calpu predicts that the maturing GameFi segment and proliferating NFT marketplaces will drive continued growth for the sector. “GameFi (or NFT sports) is also a trend that is picking up steam and we should see some huge developments this year in that category,” he said. “Another huge trend will be the proliferation of marketplaces.” If all that wasn’t enough, Coinbase’s forthcoming NFT marketplace could introduce them to millions more users. Even so, DappRadar’s Herrera warns that the NFT market is a bit frothy and like all markets will face a reckoning. “It is probable that we see a correction phase where the floor of most collections might go down a bit,” he said. That, of course, will be the big test on whether NFTs truly do constitute an asset class that stands apart from the rest of blockchain technology and not just a pop culture fad that fizzles out. ']"

['Market Action: Taking Stock of a Brutal Month in DeFi'],"[""In this week's Market Action report, Sam Haig takes stock of the rough month in DeFi in January, and how NFTs bucked the trend. By: Samuel Haig It’s time to sort out the damage from the January plunge. And take note of a silver lining. Terra (Luna), the DeFi sector’s largest asset and second-ranked network, was among the hardest hit, with its price crumbling by half while TVL dropped more than a third over the past month. The combined capitalization of DeFi assets has failed to bounce alongside leading cryptocurrencies this past week. DeFi assets are at $109B according to CoinGecko, up just 3.3% since a four-month low of $105.3B on Jan. 28. By contrast, Ether is up 24% from its Jan. 24 bottom, while Bitcoin is up nearly 15% since its local low on the same date. The DeFi market cap is down 37% since its all-time high of $174.7B on Nov. 12. DeFi assets currently represent 6% of the global crypto capitalization. Despite the DeFi market cap remaining down in the doldrums, roughly 70 of the sector’s 100 largest assets are up for the week.

Curve is the largest protocol by cross-chain TVL with $17.6B locked across eight network’s followed by Ethereum’s MakerDAO and Convex Finance with $16B and $12.4B respectively. Convex’s TVL is down 40% in the past month, while Curve has shed 27% and MakerDAO 11%. Ethereum represents nearly 60% of TVL, with $116.5B currently locked on the network. Ethereum’s TVL fell to 102.7B on Jan. 23, its lowest level since early August. The down-trend saw Fantom emerge as the fourth-largest network, with its TVL steadily growing until posting an all-time high of $12.7B on Jan. 25. Fantom now represents $9.3B, ranking behind Terra’s 13.6B and Binance Smart Chain’s $12.1B. Avalanche and Solana are closely duking it out for fifth with $8.9B and $8.6B respectively.

['JonesDAO Raises $52M in 24 Hours Amid Surging Demand for Crypto Derivatives'],"['A new crypto derivatives offering raised $52M in 24 hours, showing the demand for options as a bear market looms. By: Owen Fernau Volatility in the capital markets has long driven financial engineers to fashion new forms of managing risk. The same is true in crypto. With perpetual swaps and other derivative instruments long available to investors, the crypto market is now producing more sophisticated on-chain offerings such as Dopex, and Lyra, which deal in options and build on Ethereum Layer 2s, Now a new project called JonesDAO, which bills itself as offering one-click access to institutional grade options strategies, is jumping into the fray. It raised an astonishing $52M in 24 hours on Jan. 29, underscoring the demand for sophisticated instruments in a market that’s teetering on the edge of bear territory. (Options enable investors to preset prices for buying securities). The platform went live on Jan. 31 and has two vaults: one for ETH and one for gOHM, which is essentially a “wrapped” version of staked OHM, OlympusDAO’s currency. The ETH vault has closed as of Jan. 31 and is offering an 11.51% APY on the $3M worth of the token users have deposited, according to the JonesDAO website. The gOHM vault is still open and Jones has yet to display an APY for depositors though $2M of the token has been deposited. At a high level, Jones offers set-and-forget asset strategies for various assets. According to the project’s documentation, the protocol’s primary vaults will provide risk-averse investors access to stable yield in all market conditions. Jones will also deploy vaults for users with more appetite for risk. Jones added what the project called a “twist” to its token sale. After allocating 60% of JONES tokens allocated for the public at a fixed price of $7 to people on the whitelist with a cap of 2.16 ETH, the sale opened up to the public. The sale would raise roughly 20,200 ETH in total, but the twist came when the project actually returned 15,200 ETH to people who invested in the second round. “The purpose of the twist was to make token distribution as fair as possible, eliminate incentives for bots, scripts, and sybils, to ensure fairness to everyone who succeeded and failed to deposit in the first sale, and to those who didn’t deposit because it had sold it,” said the project in their Substack. The JONES token declined 20% to $15.23 in mid-morning trading U.K. time on Feb 1, according to CoinGecko. The token will be used in governance, and also incentivize liquidity in jAsset/Asset pools. Jones will issue jAssets to represent deposits in its vaults. With deep liquidity, users will be able to trade directly out of their jAsset position any time. For example users will be able to exchange jETH for ETH at a 1-to-1 basis. JONES will also have a locking functionality like Curve Finance, commonly known as “ve” or voting escrow tokenomics, which will allow those who lock the tokens to dictate where the JONES rewards go as well as earning a portion of the fees the protocol charges on its strategies. Token allocations for Jones. Source: The Defiant chart Jones charges 2% on the value locked in its smart contracts and a 20% performance fee on the yield generated through vaults, according to the protocol’s documentation. This structure mirrors a traditional hedge fund, which follows the 2 and 20 model (2% on assets under management and 20% on profits). Jones also raised a $3M seed round from DeFi influencer Tetranode, the meta-governance protocol [REDACTED], and more. The private sale constituted 9.7% of the total JONES tokens. Jones is built on Arbitrum, the Layer 2, continuing the trend of gas-intensive projects electing to run on Ethereum scaling solutions. ']"

['DeFi Investors Brace for Liquidations as MakerDAO and Aave Call in Collateral'],"['Key DeFi platforms are liquidating collateral amid the selloff in crypto tokens. By: Owen Fernau Now comes the liquidation phase. As crypto investors reckon with a 45% plunge in the value of the crypto market since November’s all-time high, the focus is now turning to the impact on leverage many investors use to amplify their earnings. Key platforms are liquidating the collateral users put up to secure borrowings, usually made in a stablecoin like DAI. Liquidations spiked to 1,692 on Aave, DeFi’s largest protocol, on Jan. 23. That’s the highest since the crash in late May 2021, according to data from The Defiant Terminal. Liquidations on Compound, Aave, and MakerDAO in the last year. Source: The Defiant Terminal MakerDAO, another of DeFi’s largest protocols, had its own local high of 95 liquidations which came on Jan. 22. Like Aave, that was the highest mark since late May for the protocol. While the number of Aave liquidations outpaced Maker’s, the reverse was the case for USD-denominated value of the liquidations — Maker hit $118.8M in liquidations on Jan. 21, while Aave maxed out in terms of daily highs at $61.13M on Jan. 22, according to The Defiant Terminal. Liquidation Value in USD on Compound, Aave, and MakerDAO in the last year. Source: The Defiant Terminal The Maker liquidations on Jan. 21 were discussed on Twitter by the protocol’s founder Rune Christensen who said there was over $600M in ETH in danger of liquidation at the time. While all $600M of the ETH wasn’t liquidated, the run on Jan. 21 represented the highest value of liquidation on Maker in the past year. The liquidation story in this selloff is important because it marks a big test for the functionality of DeFi in a high-stress period. While users have been rocked by liquidations in the past week, DeFi has continued to operate as intended, which is a bullish sign for its utility in the long term. Users make themselves susceptible to liquidation when they borrow against their collateral on DeFi protocols like Aave and Maker. In essence, these lending protocols allow the users to borrow assets, like Maker’s USD-pegged stablecoin DAI, if users are willing to lock up an asset like ETH. Users can only borrow up to a certain amount relative to their collateral. For example, Maker’s most popular vault allows users a max collateralization ratio of 145% which means that users up to $68,966 of DAI against $100,000 of ETH before getting liquidated. Users often borrow in order to “lever up” on their crypto positions. To lever up on ETH, a user would deposit ETH into Maker, borrow DAI against that ETH, and then trade that DAI into more ETH, essentially increasing their stack of the cryptocurrency in exchange for liquidation risk as well as Maker’s interest rates. In the meantime, the plunge in token values themselves may continue to put pressure on the space and exacerbate liquidations. Ethereum has dropped 25% in the last week to $2,401, a price level web3 enthusiasts haven’t seen since July when the cryptocurrency was coming out of a severe sell-off in May. Other major Layer 1s (L1) are down too — in fact, all major L1 smart contract platforms, have lost a fifth of their value in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko. The exception is Terra’s LUNA, which is down 16.9% in that time span. Cosmos’ ATOM, arguably a Layer 1 though not categorized as a smart contract platform by CoinGecko, is also down 8.2% on the week.  ']"

['LooksRare Surges to $7B Valuation as Torrid Volumes Fuel Staking Rewards'],"['LooksRare is making a move in the NFT market. By: yyctrader LooksRare, the upstart NFT marketplace that airdropped its $LOOKS token to NFT traders on Jan. 9, is having a stellar run. Over $5B worth of NFTs have been traded on the marketplace since the platform launched just ten days ago, and trading volume has consistently surpassed that of OpenSea, the NFT marketplace leader. (Source: @hildobby Dune Analytics) $LOOKS briefly traded north of $7 on Jan. 20, giving the project a fully diluted valuation of $7.1B. The token has since fallen to $5, in line with the broader market sell-off. OpenSea closed its latest Series C funding round at a valuation of $13B. Is LooksRare really worth half as much as the industry leader in less than two weeks? Or could something else be going on here? Let’s dive in. OpenSea has established itself as the dominant NFT marketplace, with the lion’s share of overall NFT users and trading volume. Despite its success, OpenSea routinely comes under fire for its centralized corporate structure and reliance on venture capital funding. LooksRare has capitalized on these perceived shortcomings, positioning itself as the ‘community-first’ NFT marketplace. In contrast to OpenSea, which keeps a 2.5% cut of all sales on its platform, all of the trading fees (currently 2%) on LooksRare are paid to $LOOKS stakers. Stakers also earn additional $LOOKS tokens in the form of emissions, and the combination has delivered triple-digit yields since the launch of the project. “Show me the incentive and I’ll show you the outcome” – Charlie Munger LooksRare has seen nearly three times the trading volume of OpenSea since it launched. However, comparing user and transaction counts over the same period paints a completely different picture. The data indicate that a small number of users are making high-value transactions on LooksRare, and there’s a good reason for that. LooksRare incentivizes trading on its marketplace. Buyers and sellers earn $LOOKS tokens based on their share of the total daily volume traded on the platform. For the first 30 days, 2.87M $LOOKS per day are allocated to trading rewards. At the current price of $5, that’s nearly $15M in daily rewards. If we look at the top traded collections on LooksRare, we can see that the leaders are collections with zero royalties. Many of these NFTs changed hands at absurdly high prices, clearly wash trades executed to boost trading volumes and earn rewards. Wash trading in NFT terms refers to buying and selling an item between wallets that you control. For example, Meebit #8319 has been ‘traded’ multiple times between the same two wallets over the last day. The Defiant reached out to LooksRare for comment via Twitter DM but has yet to receive a response. Twitter user El Yogui has shared a spreadsheet analyzing wash trading profitability at various volume and price levels. Higher volumes mean more trading fees for $LOOKS stakers and the resulting yield entices more buyers in a ‘flywheel’ effect that’s been working well so far. Is it sustainable? It’s too early to tell, given that LooksRare is just ten days old. Trading and staking rewards will be cut in half on Feb 10, so it will be interesting to see how the token and platform perform leading up to the event. Yield aggregator Pickle Finance has launched a new strategy that uses the WETH earned from trading rewards to buy and stake more $LOOKS tokens. This may be of interest to $LOOKS bulls. For more conservative farmers, hedging using perpetual futures is another option since $LOOKS has been listed on various centralized exchanges. By staking $LOOKS and taking an equivalent short position in the futures market, one can earn the lucrative staking yield (less the funding fee on the short position) without the price risk. Note that funding rates have been consistently negative, so this may already be a crowded trade.  ']"

['Crypto Markets Throw Tantrum as Fed Prepares To Target Inflation'],"['Why crypto investors are concerned about monetary tightening. By: yyctrader Inflation has become an urgent topic of discussion ever since the U.S. Federal Reserve released minutes of its December meeting, indicating that it’s willing to take a harder line on inflation, which hit a 39-year high in December. Crypto markets were hit hard over the last two weeks, with Bitcoin briefly trading below $40,000 for the first time since September 2021. Markets have since recouped some losses after the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data this week came out just above expectations. But why is inflation suddenly in the spotlight? And why have crypto investors become ardent Fed-watchers? Aren’t we building a new financial system that’s supposed to be independent from TradFi? To answer those questions, we’ll need to look back at the last two decades. At the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, there was clearly a need for unprecedented action to prevent a total collapse of the financial system. Global central banks worked in tandem to flood the system with liquidity and bailed out troubled banks using public funds. The results were immediate. Global stock markets rallied strongly, and we went back to business as usual. Fears of triggering another recession by withdrawing stimulus measures too soon resulted in interest rates remaining artificially low for far longer than necessary. Politicians around the world quickly realized that turning on the money printer was an easy solution to crises. Rising stock markets coupled with low inflation meant they could spend their way out of problems while maintaining public support. The wealthy saw their fortunes multiply beyond imagination as liquidity flowed into financial assets like stocks and real estate, while the average Joe continued to plod along with the prices of everyday goods remaining relatively stable. The European debt crisis a decade ago prompted ECB chairman Mario Draghi’s famous pledge to “do whatever it takes” to save the euro, and the practice continues to this day, as we’ve seen with trillions of dollars in COVID stimulus measures. Now, an entire generation of investors has become accustomed to an era of cheap money, facilitated by the Fed and other central banks around the world over the last fifteen years. Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin as a response to the global financial crash and the Great Recession of 2008-09. One of the driving factors was a fear of inflation due to a rapidly increasing money supply. Well, here we are 16 years later, and the US money supply has almost tripled at an unprecedented pace. While moderate inflation is healthy for a growing economy, economists fear excessive price hikes over a prolonged period can lead to hyperinflation and a complete loss of confidence in the national currency. People expect their money to be worth less in the future, and sell their currency for other assets as soon as they receive it, exacerbating a vicious cycle of devaluation. Hyperinflation is truly a nightmare scenario for any nation, as people’s hard-earned savings become virtually worthless overnight. We’re seeing it unfold right now in Venezuela, where annual inflation was 686% in 2021. Consider that figure for a moment. Can you imagine your net worth being slashed by 85% in a single year just because you held your savings in your national currency, as most people do? History is replete with examples of failed currencies, and so central banks tend to take action long before the situation gets out of hand. This brings us back to the Fed’s recent pivot. Since the ‘COVID Crash’ of March 2020, the Fed has kicked the money printer into overdrive, injecting $120B of liquidity into the markets every month through bond purchases. Benchmark interest rates were once again dropped to near-zero, reversing the hikes of 2016-2019. In such an environment, speculators are rewarded at the expense of savers. Ordinary people want to save money for college tuition or a new house, but with bank deposits yielding next to nothing, they are forced to risk capital in the stock market. There’s no doubt 2021 was a great year for risk assets, as everything from coffee to crypto rallied higher. But it’s the rapid rise in the prices of essential goods that’s spurring the Fed to take action. On November 3, it announced that monthly bond purchases would be scaled back by $15B a month, with the program expected to be wound down by Summer 2022. At the time, no interest rate hikes were pencilled in for 2022. As the world’s reserve currency, the majority of risk assets are priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar is generally considered positive for risk and credit markets. The mechanics of how this works through the Eurodollar market are beyond the scope of this article, but you can read more here. The greenback rallied sharply in the wake of the announcement and proceeded to hit levels last seen in July 2020 over the next three weeks. Bitcoin topped at $69K on November 10 and dropped 30% over the following month as total crypto market capitalization dropped to $2.2T from a high of nearly $3T. We’ve seen a lot of institutional adoption of crypto in 2021, and while that is undoubtedly positive for the space, it could also explain crypto markets’ increased sensitivity to monetary and fiscal policy. Old habits die hard on Wall Street. One must understand that professional investors are not degens. Money managers are expected to operate within strict risk management parameters or risk losing their cushy Wall Street gigs. With the consensus view expecting tighter monetary conditions going forward, fund managers will look to pare risk. If we look at the risk spectrum of asset classes, crypto can be considered one of the riskiest. So, it’s a natural place for asset managers to start cutting positions to protect their outsized gains of 2021. Most institutions are trend-followers and will not hesitate to exit their positions if macro conditions call for it. How many banks announced crypto trading desks in 2017 and 2018 only to abandon their plans when the market imploded? On Dec. 15, the Fed announced that it would accelerate the reductions in monthly bond purchases and end the program by March 2022. While markets took the news in stride, the minutes released last week showed that the committee now expects as many as three rate hikes in 2022. Investors generally don’t like surprises, and this time was no different. Equity markets traded lower and we saw another wave of selling in crypto, with Bitcoin and Ether briefly trading below $40,000 and $3,000 respectively. Bond markets currently predict a 78% chance of a 0.25% hike in March. Investment bank Goldman Sachs says the Fed will raise rates four times in 2022. While the majority of investors seem to be taking the Fed’s projections as a done deal, there are some factors that may yet influence the actual path taken by the world’s largest central bank. For one, 2021 may have been an outlier. A combination of supply shocks caused by the COVID pandemic and direct monetary stimulus boosting consumer demand may have resulted in an inflation spike. If this is the case, we can expect inflation to abate naturally as conditions return to normal. Secondly, this is an election year in the US. While Democrats will want to present themselves as tough on inflation, they would also want to keep the markets stable. An overcorrection leading to a stock market crash would hurt the incumbents. If the pandemic were to worsen or the economy runs into headwinds, we can’t rule out the possibility of another stimulus package. In the short term, the bounce is likely to continue, as funding rates have turned negative, indicating that traders are being paid to open long positions. Previous periods of sustained negative funding rates have tended to precede positive price action. If we think of the US Dollar as a crypto token, the Fed can be viewed as the developers controlling its supply. For the last two decades, they’ve been hitting the ‘infinite mint’ button. Now, with inflation in the spotlight, will the devs do something?  ']"

The move comes amid a strong bounce for Ethereum and decentralized finance assets, with ETH trading at $3,250 after jumping 11.3% from its local low are down for the day. NFTs are also climbing, with daily volume on leading marketplace OpenSea posting new highs this month. According to the Ultrasound Money, Ethereum’s burn rate beat out its previous record by more than 1,000 Ether, with 16,910 ETH having been destroyed within 24 hours on Oct. 28 at a rate of 12 ETH every minute. OpenSea was the single-largest source of burnt Ether, with 2,755 ETH destroyed within 24 hours. ETH transfers ranked second with 1,592 ETH, followed by Uniswap v3 with 1,213 ETH, Tether with 623 ETH, and the LOOKSRARE airdrop with 573 ETH. Looking at 2021, Uniswap was the single-largest source of gas expended between its v2 and v3 deployments, representing roughly 40% of the gwei consumed by the top 20 gas-guzzling protocols, according to data from Nansen. OpenSea posted dramatic growth in 2021, ranking second overall by gas consumed. The protocol closed the year at 30% despite representing barely 1% of network activity 12 months ago. 1inch ranked third, although its share of gas consumed dropped by nearly half during the year, closing near 5% after opening at 10%. Seventh-ranked Aave experienced a similar trend, ending the year at just a couple of percent after sitting at 5% in January. Chainlink came in 11th after a dramatic loss in share of network activity during the year, comprising barely 1% after representing 10% of activity among top-ranking protocols during much of Q1 2021. Axie Infinity similarly spent much of Q3 at 10% despite opening and closing the year in low single-digits. Most other top-ranking protocols maintained a consistent share of network activity throughout the year, including Wrapped Ethereum, Tether, USD Coin, 0x, SushiSwap, and Curve. Ethereum’s fee market was overhauled in August with the launch of EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee that is burned by the network alongside a tip that is received by transaction validators. With the coming Ethereum chain-merge set to remove Proof-of-Work block rewards from ETH issuance and network activity soaring this past year, many analysts are predicting the burn mechanism will underscore a deflationary Ethereum 2.0.

The spiking burn rate has come at a cost for Ethereum holders, with the asset losing 7% of its value to trade at its lowest level since September 2021. The heavy losses sustained by many leading DeFi tokens likely contributed to the burn rate too, as traders rushed to reduce exposure to many mid-cap crypto assets.

Rebounding interest in NFTs has added significantly to the burn rate, with the number of ETH burned by leading marketplace OpenSea increasing by more than double in the past fortnight. OpenSea destroyed 8,541 ETH this past week. ETH transfers were the second-largest source of Ether burnt, removing 5,889 Ether from supply in seven days, followed by Uniswap v3 with 5,251 ETH, Tether with 2,539 ETH, and Uniswap v2 with 1,733 ETH.

['Got Bear Market Blues? Read This'],"[""A bear market seems imminent in crypto. But it may not be a foregone conclusion given Ethereum's upcoming projects. By: Samuel Haig Is a bear market a foregone conclusion? That’s the vibe as we head into the new year. And there’s little doubt why — the December selloff has stung and the market is confronting a litany of challenges. For starters, the crypto market has lost a fifth of its value since peaking in November. Investors have been shedding risk in the face of the Omicron outbreak and central banks’ moves to fight soaring inflation and taper government support for their respective economies. (Stock markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia have also declined in the fourth quarter). At the same time, regulators such as Gary Gensler at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Janet Yellen at the U.S. Department of the Treasury seem determined to crack down on crypto platforms and stablecoins. This comes on the heels of the legislation that passed this summer requiring crypto ventures in the U.S. to collect and report tax data for their clients, a costly chore many projects are ill-equipped to execute. If all that wasn’t enough, leading crypto exchange Binance is under investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s probe into possible tax evasion, money laundering, and insider trading. And traders are wondering if the unprecedented bull market that’s created so much upside since April 2020 has finally run its course. Cycles do end after all, and with the market cap of crypto assets up 200% in 2021 and an astonishing 1,100% since the start of 2020, a long deceleration seems like a natural progression. Even so, there are some positive initiatives underway in the Ethereum community that could change the narrative. The Eth2 chain-merge is currently estimated to go live during the first half of 2022, bolstering staking returns and eliminating mining rewards as inflationary pressure on Ether’s supply. Further, with the burn rate and network activity surging, Ethereum 2.0 is expected to enjoy deflationary issuance once mining rewards have been eliminated — meaning that ETH will likely be destroyed at a rate outpacing the creation of new coins. Moreover, Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem is also only getting started. Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge rollups are promising to scale the network’s throughput by up to 100x, according to Vitalik Buterin. Gas costs for rollup networks are also expected to see a 5x reduction with the forthcoming EIP-4488 upgrade. That could be a huge lift for sentiment in DeFi. Let’s not forget that the double-digit plunge in DeFi assets in December also creates a lot of space under all-time highs. And if there’s one thing we know about market behavior in this space it’s that investors like to close those gaps. They just need a reason. Ethereum 2.0 might just provide one. ""]"

['Yearn Finance Changes Up its Tokenomics and YFI Soars 85%'],"['Yearn Finance has soared following a change in its tokenomics. By: Owen Fernau It’s been a tough year for many DeFi protocols originating on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite being up in dollar terms, top tokens like UNI, MAKER, AAVE and Yearn Finance’s YFI have bled double digits against ETH in 2021. There may be respite for one of them. Yearn, the yield aggregator, has introduced new tokenomics and its YFI token jumped 87.1% in the seven days ending Dec. 20, according to CoinGecko. The apparent catalyst for YFI’s momentum is the token’s revamped tokenomics, according to a post linked by Yearn on Dec. 19. The proposal hasn’t been approved, but it is expected to do so, according to the post, which says the mechanics will create a “black hole “for YFI, meaning supply will come off the market along with a corresponding price increase. First and foremost among the proposed changes is the ability to stake YFI in exchange for xYFI, holders of which will receive additional YFI which Yearn buys on the open market. The mechanic will directly reward stakers while the purchases push YFI’s price northward. The second proposed change builds off the first and is modelled off Curve Finance, the automated market maker (AMM). Users will be able to choose how long to lock their YFI up — the longer a person locks, the more rewards earned. This mechanic incentivizes a decrease in the circulating supply of YFI. Users will also receive veYFI tokens, used for voting, proportional to how long they lock up their YFI. A visualization of Yearn Finance under the proposed changes. The third element, building upon the first two, is a gauge system. At a high level this means that users will be able to stake their yTokens, which represent deposits in Yearn vaults, earning further YFI according to how much veYFI they hold. A fourth and final aspect of the proposal involves “useful work features,” which the writeup says will expand the duties and responsibilities of veYFI voters and their locked YFI in exchange for further protocol rewards. Yearn makes money through a 2% management fee, taken as a percentage of a users’ deposited assets and 20% performance fee, taken against the yield generated by a particular vault. YFI is up a more humble 14.62% on the month, but is the only token with positive movement in that timeframe among all the constituents of the DeFi Pulse Index, DeFi’s top index in market cap terms. In fact, every other token in DPI is down at least 18.29% on the month as of Dec. 20, according to TokenSets, an asset management platform.  ']"

By: Samuel Haig Terra is still on a roll. Defying a relentless selloff across crypto markets, the Layer 1 smart contract platform’s LUNA continues to capture DeFi marketshare. In the last week, the network’s TVL surged 43% to surpass Binance Smart Chain and rank second with 17.7B in total value locked. LUNA now accounts for one-fifth of the combined DeFi market cap, according to according to CoinGecko. LUNA was the third-best performing DeFi token for the week, with cross-chain bridge AnySwap and yield aggregator Yearn Finance topping the rankings with 53.7% and 51.4% respectively.

The gain comes amid surging growth for the network’s three-largest protocols, with Anchor’s TVL sitting at $7.51 after growing 23.6% in seven days, Lido representing $5.29B after gaining 12%, and Terraswap comprising $1.91B after its capital locked increased by a whopping 78.9%. Delphi Labs’ automated market maker Astroport also emerged as Terra’s fourth-largest protocol after attracting more than $1B through its lock drop. The top four projects now represent 89.3% of Terra’s TVL combined. Leading network Ethereum was one of the poorest performing networks for the week, now at $149.9B after losing $13.4B or 8.2% of its TVL this past week. Despite six of its 10 largest protocols posting modest growth over the past seven days, several nine-figure protocols suffered heavy losses. That includes Olympus DAO with 59.1%, MochiFi with 31.4%, and Notional with 26.8%. TempleDAO also shed a whopping 82.6% for the week, sitting at $31.9M after boasting a TVL exceeding $180M two days ago.

['CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Rule New Index Fund for NFT Blue Chips'],"['A new index fund for NFTs is the latest sign of the financialization of the space. By: Samuel Haig In the latest sign that NFTs are rapidly morphing into a new type of security, an index fund has hit the market, and CryptoPunks and Bored Apes are firmly in charge. On Dec. 17, Bitwise Asset Management, a leading crypto index fund manager with more than $1.7B in managed assets, launched the Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index Fund. Matt Hougan, the firm’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), says it is the first fund of its kind. But it will only be available to accredited investors, with a minimum investment size set at $25,000. The index fund is designed to make it easier for investors to own the top 10 most valuable nonfungible token collections, weighting and selecting collections based on their market capitalization and floor prices. The product, which is similar to equity index funds, rebalances quarterly. CryptoPunks comprise 37.5% of the index and Bored Ape Yacht Club accounts for 29.7%. The remaining third includes Veefriends, Autoslyphs, Fidenza, Cyberkorgz Genesis, Cool Cats, Meebis, and Chromie Squiggle with between 5.4% and 2.5% each. “The goal: Own the iconic blue-chips of today, & add those that emerge in the future,” said Hougan. The product will exclude NFT collections that feature less than 100 tokens due to their illiquidity, in addition to NFTs representing music rights, virtual land, and game items. “The focus is on arts & collectibles,” Hougan added. Hougan said NFTs are positioned “at the edge of crypto innovation” and are “rapidly becoming prized artifacts of our new digital era.” However, he also highlighted the risks associated with the nascent sector. The market is volatile, liquidity can be challenging, and custody is evolving,” he tweeted. Despite the adolescence of the nonfungible token sector, the financialization of NFTs is moving fast, with VC firm Three Arrows Capital teaming up with centralized crypto lending company Nexo to allow tokens from top NFT collections to be used as collateral for digital asset loans. The firms began accepting applications for their new NFT Lending Desk on Dec. 16, announcing that Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks will both be supported. Additional supported collections will be announced in the coming weeks. Users will be able to borrow stablecoins, Ether, and other digital assets worth up to 20% of the value of their NFT collateral. The lending desk will not impose liquidations on loans before their maturity, “even if the value of your NFT fluctuates during the course of the loan.”  ']"

['Questions Swirl as Solana Loses a Fifth of its Value in Seven Days'],"['Solana, a DeFi darling that vaulted into the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency, has taken the biggest hit of major tokens in the last seven days. By: Owen Fernau The carnage has been widespread in this latest selloff. Yet no major DeFi name has tumbled as much as Solana, the would-be challenger to Ethereum. After quintupling between August and November, SOL became the fifth most valuable token in crypto with a market cap exceeding $77B. In the last seven days, Solana’s SOL has skidded 17%, the second-worst performance in the top 20 of all crypto tokens, according to data in midday trading New York time from CoinGecko. So what gives? Why is Solana, a protocol that Sam Bankman-Fried said had the potential to become as big as Ethereum, dropping so precipitously? That’s not an easy question to answer and it may be that investors simply believe Solana was way too frothy. But the drop does come on the heels of a tumultuous weekend when the project was criticized for reported DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. “The attack exploited fundamental design flaws which are considered features by SOL,” tweeted Justin Bons, a researcher and the founder of CyberCapital, an investment firm. He said it was possible to predict and attack “the next block producers inline,” meaning its blockchain was faulty. While Solana stayed online it has been struck before. In September, Solana said the network went down for 17 hours after a DDoS attack. No money was lost, it said. Solana’s market cap (in blue) has underperformed Ethereum’s in the last seven days. Source: CoinGecko Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana Labs’ CEO and co-founder, countered Bons on Twitter. “In summary this is straight up bs,” he tweeted. He said Bons’ technical analysis was incorrect and that Solana’s blockchain was sound.“DDOS targeting a single leader will only delay that single leader even if the ddos perfectly marches with the poh schedule,” he tweeted. “A liveness ddos attack needs to cover 1/3+ weight of ALL the physical links in the network.”  This would put Solana in a similar category to Ethereum, whose in-progress transition to proof-of-stake would still leave the blockchain vulnerable to 51% attacks, according to ethereum.org. Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, elaborated on this explanation. “During an initial DEX offering (IDO) a number of transactions were sent that landed in Solana blocks that took an excessive amount of compute power,” Federa told The Defiant. An IDO is a mechanism that uses a DEX, like Solana’s Raydium, to raise funds. “The compute for those kinds of transactions wasn’t properly metered by the network, and caused the blocks to take much longer to process than the network expected.” Compute essentially means the processing power required to carry out a given task. Federa said a similar problem happened last Friday when Bons sent his tweet alleging a DDoS attack. “The network was not down at any point,” Federa said, adding that improvements to transaction metering are live in testnet-form with those changes set for merge with Solana’s mainnet in the coming months. Technical concerns are apparently having some impact with two Solana NFT projects postponed their mints on Dec. 13. One of the two cited DDoS attacks for the delay and the other cited unstable transactions per second. Even so, the kerfuffle doesn’t appear to have deterred Justin Kan, the co-founder of Twitch, the social media gaming giant, from building on Solana — in Dec. 13, Kan introduced a marketplace for gaming NFTs to be built on Solana on Dec. 13.
